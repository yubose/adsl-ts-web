              text: "Two common ear conditions may affect children. Acute otitis media (AOM)
                is an infection that usually involves fever, pain, and evidence
                of middle ear (behind the eardrum) inflammation with effusion
                (fluid). This is the most common type of ear infection. It is
                usually painful because parts of the middle ear are swollen and
                infected, and fluid is trapped behind the eardrum. Symptoms
                include fever and possibly puss in the ear. Infants and children
                with acute otitis media often pull on their ears. It can be
                treated with antibiotics because it's usually caused by
                bacteria, not a virus, although it can be a complication from a
                virus."

              text: "Otitis media with effusion (OME) is fluid in the middle ear without signs
                of infection. This type of ear infection is very common, and it
                is caused by the buildup of fluid in the middle ear. It often
                happens after an ear infection has run its course. Most of the
                time, children will not have pain, but a doctor will be able to
                see the fluid behind the eardrum. Otitis media with effusion
                usually goes away on its own, and antibiotics won't be
                effective. It's common to have with allergies, when exposed to
                irritants like cigarette smoke and in conjunction with viral
                upper respiratory infections."

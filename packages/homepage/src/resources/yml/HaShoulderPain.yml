              text: "Of all the reasons you can have shoulder pain, injury to your rotator
                cuff is the most common.The rotator cuff is a group of muscles
                and tendons that surround the shoulder joint, keeping the head
                of your upper arm bone firmly within the shallow socket of the
                shoulder. A rotator cuff injury can cause a dull ache in the
                shoulder, which often worsens when you try to sleep on the
                involved side.Rotator cuff injuries occur most often in people
                who repeatedly perform overhead motions in their jobs or sports.
                Examples include painters, carpenters, and people who play
                baseball or tennis. The risk of rotator cuff injury also
                increases with age."

                In those circumstances, medical care should be provided as soon
                as possible. Extensive rotator cuff tears may require surgical
                repair, transfer of alternative tendons or joint replacement.
                Other cause include: Frozen shoulder, Osteoarthritis, Dislocated

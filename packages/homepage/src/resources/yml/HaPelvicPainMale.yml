              text: "Men may have chronic pelvic pain from a number of disorders, including
                urinary dysfunction or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However,
                prostatitis is the most common male-specific cause of pelvic
                pain. Prostatitis is swelling and inflammation of the prostate
                gland, a walnut-sized gland situated directly below the bladder
                in men. The prostate gland produces fluid (semen) that nourishes
                and transports sperm. Prostatitis often causes painful or
                difficult urination. Other symptoms include pain in the groin,
                pelvic area or genitals and sometimes flu-like symptoms.
                Prostatitis affects men of all ages but tends to be more common
                in men 50 or younger. The condition has a number of causes.
                Sometimes the cause isn't identified. If prostatitis is caused
                by a bacterial infection, it can usually be treated with
                antibiotics. Depending on the cause, prostatitis can come on
                gradually or suddenly. It might improve quickly, either on its
                own or with treatment. Some types of prostatitis last for months
                or keep recurring (chronic prostatitis)."

                Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder
                and the urethra. It is a reason for pelvic pain."

                symptoms of sinusitis can be caused by other problems, such as
                viral illness and allergy. Young children are more prone to
                infections of the nose, sinus, and ears, especially in the first
                several years of life. These are most frequently caused by viral
                infections (colds), and they may be aggravated by allergies.
                However, if your child remains ill beyond the usual week to ten
                days, a sinus infection may be the cause."

                chronic constipation that can interfere with their ability to go
                about their daily tasks. Chronic constipation may also cause
                excessive straining to have a bowel movement and other signs and
                symptoms. Treatment for chronic constipation depends in part on
                the underlying cause. However, in some cases, a cause is never
                found."

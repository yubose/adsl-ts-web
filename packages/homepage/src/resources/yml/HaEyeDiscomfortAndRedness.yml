              text: "A cataract is a clouding of the eye's natural lens, which lies behind the
                iris and the pupil. Cataracts are the most common cause of
                vision loss in people over age 40 and is the principal cause of
                blindness in the world. In fact, there are more cases of
                cataracts worldwide than there are of glaucoma, macular
                degeneration and diabetic retinopathy combined, according to
                Prevent Blindness America (PBA). Timely cataract surgery can not
                only improve the visual function as early as possible, but also
                more importantly, it can deepen the space of the eye and
                effectively reduce the possibility of glaucoma development."

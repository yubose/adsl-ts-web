                that lines your eyelid and covers the white part of your
                eyeball. When small blood vessels in the conjunctiva become
                inflamed, they're more visible. This is what causes the whites
                of your eyes to appear reddish or pink. Pink eye is commonly
                caused by a bacterial or viral infection, an allergic reaction,
                or — in babies — an incompletely opened tear duct.Though pink
                eye can be irritating, it rarely affects your vision. Treatments
                can help ease the discomfort of pink eye. Because pink eye can
                be contagious, early diagnosis and treatment can help limit its
                spread."

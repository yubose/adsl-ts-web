          or MRgFUS, to heat and destroy a noncancerous growth of the uterus,
          called a leiomyomata, whose total volume is 200 cc of tissue or greater.
          The procedure is done with a patient inside a magnetic resonance imaging

          In this procedure, the provider places a stent through an incision in
          the skin into a vessel of the extracranial vertebral artery, to treat a

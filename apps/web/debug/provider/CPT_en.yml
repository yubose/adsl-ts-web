Blood circulation to\_the flap is restored through microvascular reconstruction – a process where the physician joins the existing blood vessels on the flap to the vessels at the wound site under microscopic guidance. This ensures quick healing. This method is called a Free Flap.\_ In a local flap, the flap is taken from the area surrounding the wound. In such cases one end of the flap remains connected to the skin to maintain blood supply to the flap.

          into the appropriate chamber.
    '33141':
        >-
          The provider uses laser revascularization to restore blood flow to the
          heart. She performs this service at the same encounter as another open
          cardiac procedure such as coronary artery bypass.
    '33120':
        >-
          The provider removes a tumor from the heart with the patient on
          cardiopulmonary bypass.
    '33233':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider opens the cardiac device pocket and
          removes the permanent pacemaker pulse generator.
    '33216':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider inserts a single electrode
          transvenously, or through a vein, and connects it to a permanent
          pacemaker or implantable defibrillator already in place. This procedure
          is done for a pacemaker implant or implantable defibrillator that is not
          functioning properly due to a problem with the electrode.
    '33226':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider repositions the electrode already in
          place in the left ventricular chamber of the heart. He also revises the
          skin pocket and removes, inserts, and or replaces the existing
          generator.
    '33236':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider performs a thoracotomy, to open the
          chest wall and remove the pacemaker system along with the atrial or
          ventricular electrode lead from the heart surface. He removes the
          subcutaneous pacemaker generator, from just under the skin in the chest
          wall. The pacemaker system includes the pacemaker generator, which a
          small battery powered computer like device and the lead wires that
          connect the heart muscle to the pacemaker generator.
    '33215':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider repositions an electrode that is already
          in place within the right atrium or right ventricle of a patient’s
          heart. This procedure is done for a pacemaker implant or implantable
          defibrillator that is not functioning properly due to improper electrode
          placement or lead dislodgement.
    '33237':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider performs a thoracotomy, to open the
          chest wall and remove the pacemaker system along with the two electrode
          leads from the heart surface. She also removes the subcutaneous
          pacemaker generator, just under the skin in the chest wall. A pacemaker
          system includes a pacemaker generator, a small battery powered computer
          like device and lead wires that connect the heart muscle to the
          pacemaker generator.
    '33220':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider disconnects and repairs two electrodes
          from an impulse generator, like a pacemaker or an implanted cardiac
          defibrillator, and then reattaches the electrodes to the generator. He
          performs this service for a pacemaker implant or implantable
          defibrillator that is not functioning properly due to a problem with the
          electrode.
    '33217':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider inserts two electrodes transvenously,
          through the vein and connects it to a permanent pacemaker or implantable
          defibrillator already in place. This procedure is done for a pacemaker
          implant or implantable defibrillator that is not functioning properly
          due to a problem with the electrode.
    '33224':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider introduces an additional pacing
          electrode for left ventricular pacing through a vein and advances it to
          the left ventricle. He attaches the electrode to an existing pacemaker
          or implantable defibrillator. He may also revise, remove and insert, or
          replace the existing impulse generator. The provider performs this
          procedure in patients with a high risk of heart failure who need
          biventricular pacing to help keep the heart beat in balance.
    '33218':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider disconnects and repairs a single
          electrode from an impulse generator, like a pacemaker or an implanted
          cardiac defibrillator, and then reattaches the electrode to the
          generator. He performs this service for a pacemaker implant or
          implantable defibrillator that is not functioning properly due to a
          problem with the electrode.
    '33225':
        >-
          In this add–on procedure, the provider introduces an additional pacing
          electrode for left ventricular pacing through a vein and advances it to
          the left ventricle at the same time as he inserts an implantable
          defibrillator or pacemaker pulse generator. The provider performs this
          procedure in patients with sick sinus syndrome, arterioventricular
          block, or both, with the goal to upgrade the pacemaker to a dual chamber
          system.
    '33234':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider makes an incision to open the pacemaker
          pocket and disconnects and removes a single atrial or ventricular
          electrode lead.

        >-
          In this procedure, the provider makes an incision to open the pacemaker
          pocket and disconnects and removes two electrode leads from the
          generator.
    '33223':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider creates a new pocket in a different
          location and relocates the defibrillator device pocket in a patient with
          an existing implantable defibrillator. The provider performs this
          procedure as a result of a complication such as an infection or erosion
          at the original site.
    '33222':
        >-
          In a patient with an existing pacemaker pocket, the physician creates a
          new pocket in a different location and relocates the pacer
    '33238':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider performs a thoracotomy, to open the
          chest wall and remove the permanent transvenous electrode from the heart
          surface. This procedure usually occurs after the removal of the
          generator and the cutting only of the leads in a prior procedure.
    '33300':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider repairs a wound to the heart without the
          need to place the patient on a cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, machine.
    '33241':
        >-
          The provider opens the surgically created pocket in the chest wall and
          removes an implantable defibrillator pulse generator. Defibrillators
          sense and regulate the heart rate by delivering a mild electric shock
          when the patient requires it. Components need to be removed when they no
          longer function properly or when an infection occurs.
    '33244':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider incises the skin of the chest over the
          cardiac device pocket and disconnects and removes a single or dual
          chamber implantable defibrillator. She removes the electrode lead by
          transvenous extraction, which means she pulls it out through a vein.
          Defibrillators sense and regulate the heart rate by delivering a mild
          electric shock when the patient requires it. Components need to be
          removed when they no longer function properly or when an infection
          occurs.
    '33249':
        >-
          The provider either replaces or implants a new permanent defibrillator
          system with single or dual chamber transvenous leads or electrodes.
          Defibrillators sense and regulate the heart rate by delivering a mild
          electric shock when the patient requires it. Components need to be
          removed when they no longer function properly or when an infection
          occurs.
    '33261':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider destroys a small area of the ventricle
          of the heart that is causing an abnormal heart rhythm. The provider
          places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass during this procedure.
    '33243':
        >-
          The provider performs a thoracotomy, an incision in the chest wall, and
          opens the chest cavity to remove a single or dual chamber implantable
          defibrillator electrode. Defibrillators sense and regulate the heart
          rate by delivering a mild electric shock when the patient requires it.
          Components need to be removed when they no longer function properly or
          when an infection occurs.
    '33250':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider destroys a small area of the heart above
          the ventricles of the heart that is causing an abnormal heart rhythm.
          The provider does not place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass during
          this procedure.
    '33240':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider places a new implantable defibrillator
          pulse generator in a patient in a subcutaneous pocket in the front of
          the patient’s chest. The provider performs this procedure for a patient
          with a lead in one chamber of the heart. The service is primarily done
          for artificial regulation of a patient’s heart rate by the device in
          patients with arrhythmia, which is an irregular heart rhythm.
    '33251':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider destroys a small area of the heart above
          the ventricles of the heart that is causing an abnormal heart rhythm.
          The provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass during the
          procedure.
    '33406':
        >-
          A provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass and, using an
          open surgical approach, replaces a diseased or defective aortic valve
          with an allograft (a tissue graft harvested from one person for another)
          using a freehand technique. She performs this procedure to restore
          proper blood supply to the body.
    '33404':
        >-
          An apicoaortic conduit (AAC), also called an aortic valve bypass (AVB),
          is a cardiovascular procedure the provider performs to reduce symptoms
          due to blood flow obstruction from the left ventricle of the heart. The
          provider treats the obstruction of blood flow by creating an apicoaortic
          conduit (channel) and valve to bypass the native aortic valve.
    '33320':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider uses sutures to repair the great vessels
          of the heart, or the large vessels that bring blood to and from the
          heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, or the
          vena cava. The provider does not use a shunt or cardiopulmonary bypass,
          or CPB, to perform this procedure.
    '33305':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider repairs a wound to the heart with the
          patient on a cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, machine.
    '33335':
        >-
          The provider repairs the aorta or another great vessel using a graft
          while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass.
    '33315':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider incises the heart to find and remove a
          foreign body or clot in the heart. The provider places the patient on a
          cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, machine to perform this procedure.
    '33310':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider incises the heart to find and remove a
          foreign body or clot in the heart. The provider does not place the
          patient on a cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, machine to perform this
          procedure.
    '33405':
        >-
          The provider replaces the aortic valve with an artificial valve (but not
          a homograft or ventless valve) via open access with the patient on
          cardiopulmonary bypass. She performs this procedure to restore proper
          blood supply to the body.
    '33321':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider uses sutures to repair the great vessels
          of the heart, or the large vessels that bring blood to and from the
          heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, or the
          vena cava. The provider uses a shunt bypass to perform this procedure.
    '33322':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider uses sutures to repair the great vessels
          of the heart, or the large vessels that bring blood to and from the
          heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, or the
          vena cava. The provider uses cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, to perform
          this procedure.
    '33330':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider inserts a graft into the great vessels
          of the heart, or the large vessels that bring blood to and from the
          heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, or the
          vena cava. The provider does not use a shunt or cardiopulmonary bypass,
          or CPB, to perform this procedure.
    '33420':
        >-
          The provider corrects mitral valve stenosis dilating the cusps, or
          leaflets, of the mitral valve without stopping the heart from beating or
          putting the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.
    '33427':
        >-
          The provider performs a valvuloplasty, which is a surgical repair of the
          mitral valve or subvalvular structures to correct mitral stenosis or
          subvalvular fibrosis with the patient on a heart–lung machine to reroute
          the circulation of blood and bypass the heart and lungs. The provider
          may insert a band or ring around the anulus to correct mitral
          insufficiency if the valve is leaking due to annular dilatation.
    '33430':
        >-
          The mitral valve of the heart controls the passage of blood from the
          left atrium to the left ventricle. When it fails to perform this duty
          due to disease, then a replacement surgery might be the only option if a
          repair is not feasible. Stenosis, or narrowing, of the mitral valve
          leads to failure of the valve to open fully. Stenosis may be caused by
          rheumatic heart disease or calcification of the leaflets. Another
          condition that may require a valve replacement is regurgitation in which
          the valve fails to prevent the reverse flow of blood to the atrium and
          lungs. Mitral regurgitation could be the result of a genetic disorder or
          due to a disease such as cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease.
    '33460':
        >-
          The provider performs a valvectomy, which is an excision of the
          tricuspid valve to treat regurgitation, which is often the result of
          vegetations on the valve from infective endocarditis.
    '33411':
        >-
          The provider replaces the patient's heart valve with an artificial one.
          Enlargement of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement
          permits insertion of a larger prosthetic valve. The procedure treats
          aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation.
    '33414':
        >-
          The provider treats a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by
          using a patch to enlarge the outflow tract.
    '33413':
        >-
          In this surgery known as the Ross procedure, the provider replaces the
          aortic valve with the pulmonary valve. The procedure treats aortic valve
          stenosis or regurgitation.
    '33410':
        >-
          The provider replaces the patient's heart valve with an artificial
          stentless valve, which is an artificial valve not attached to a stent or
          frame. A stentless valve may provide for better blood flow and surgical
          implant options. The procedure treats aortic valve stenosis or
          regurgitation.
    '33415':
        >-
          The provider removes or incises the subvalvular tissue of the aorta to
          treat subvalvular aortic stenosis, a rare congenital disorder where the
          heart's walls become thick, thereby reducing the size of the heart's
          chambers and obstructing blood flow.
    '33412':
        >-
          The provider replaces the patient's heart valve with an artificial one.
          Enlargement of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement
          permits insertion of a larger prosthetic valve. The procedure treats
          aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation. In the Konno procedure, the
          provider repairs a congenital, or present since birth, aortic stenosis
          of the junction of the left ventricle and aorta and replaces the valve.
    '33426':
        >-
          A valvuloplasty is performed to repair the valve so that it closes
          properly and prevents the backflow of blood from the left ventricle to
          the left atrium.
    '33416':
        >-
          The provider performs a ventriculomyotomy or ventriculomyectomy, an
          incision into the muscular heart wall, which may include removing part
          of the muscle. The procedure treats idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic
          stenosis, a disorder that causes hypertrophy, or enlargement of the left
          ventricle, which causes obstructed blood flow.
    '33417':
        >-
          The provider performs an aortoplasty (repair of the aorta) to treat
          supravalvular stenosis, a congenital heart defect that causes aortic
          stenosis.
    '33422':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider opens the chest to repair the narrowed
          and stiff mitral valve. The mitral valve controls the passage of blood
          from the left atrium, which is the collecting chamber, to the left
          ventricle, which is the pumping chamber. The provider releases the stiff
          valve while the patient is under the control of an artificial heart–lung
          machine.
    '33425':
        >-
          The provider performs an open heart mitral valve repair to dilate a
          stenosed mitral valve, using a heart–lung machine to reroute the
          circulation of blood and bypass the heart and lungs.
    '33501':
        >-
          The provider ties off or closes a fistula, an abnormal passageway from a
          coronary artery to the pulmonary vein or from a coronary artery to a
          cardiac chamber. He does not put the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.
          The procedure prevents complications such as thrombus, endocarditis, or
          aneurysm rupture.
    '33475':
        >-
          The provider removes the pulmonary valve and replaces it with an
          artificial valve. Adults who had procedures to correct congenital heart
          defects as infants sometimes require this procedure, which corrects
          pulmonary regurgitation that often results in right ventricular
          hypertrophy.
    '33496':
        >-
          With the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, the provider repairs a
          dysfunctional or leaking prosthetic valve that is not working properly
          due to overgrowth of vascular structures or exudate.
    '33471':
        >-
          The provider accesses the pulmonary valve through the pulmonary artery,
          without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, and performs a valvotomy,
          incising and dilating the valve to treat pulmonary valve stenosis.
    '33474':
        >-
          With the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, the provider accesses the
          pulmonary valve via the pulmonary artery and incises the valve leaflets,
          or cusps, to enlarge the valve opening and correct pulmonary stenosis.
    '33478':
        >-
          The provider places a graft to enlarge the ventricular outflow tract. If
          necessary, he incises the junctions of the valve leaflets or removes
          thickened muscular tissue from the infundibulum. This procedure relieves
          obstruction of the ventricular outflow tract. Indications for this
          procedure include pulmonary atresia.
    '33500':
        >-
          With the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, the provider closes a
          fistula, either from outside the heart or from inside a cardiac chamber.
          He performs this procedure to close off the abnormal passageway that
          allows blood to flow where it should not.
    '33463':
        >-
          The provider performs surgical repair of the tricuspid valve to correct
          tricuspid valve regurgitation.
    '33465':
        >-
          The provider replaces the tricuspid valve with the patient on
          cardiopulmonary bypass. The tricuspid valve consists of three triangular
          membranous flaps (leaflets or cusps) and is situated at the opening of
          the right atrium into the right ventricle.
    '33464':
        >-
          The provider performs tricuspid valvuloplasty, which is the repair of a
          valve, with ring insertion to treat tricuspid regurgitation.
    '33468':
        >-
          The provider performs tricuspid valve repositioning and plication to
          correct the displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets in Ebstein
          anomaly.
    '33476':
        >-
          The provider performs right ventricular resection, removing obstructive
          bands of fiber in the infundibulum and, if necessary, performs a
          commissurotomy, i.e., he incises the junctions of the leaflets. This
          procedure treats infundibular stenosis.
    '33502':
        >-
          The provider ties off a coronary artery arising irregularly from the
          pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery cannot handle the higher pressure
          associated with blood flowing from a coronary artery; this procedure
          prevents congestive heart failure and corrects failure to thrive that
          results from such an anomaly in an infant.
    '33503':
        >-
          The provider ligates the coronary artery that arises irregularly from
          the pulmonary artery and places a graft to restore circulation to the
          heart.

          and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33506':
        >-
          After excising, or cutting out, the anomalous coronary artery opening on
          the pulmonary artery, the provider relocates it to the aorta by means of
          an anastomosis. He uses a patch graft to close the opening in the
          pulmonary artery. He performs the procedure to restore circulation to
          the heart and prevent or correct congestive heart failure, typically in
          infants with congenital heart defects.
    '33513':
        >-
          The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by

          symptoms like angina.
    '33545':
        >-
          The provider patches a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall
          between the ventricles of the heart, after a myocardial infarction,
          which results in a blood clot or other mass causing an obstruction. This
          obstruction decreases blood circulation to a part of the heart muscle.
          The provider may also perform a myocardial resection, removing damaged
          tissue from the septum, itself, if necessary.
    '33602':
        >-
          When the aortic or pulmonary semilunar valves fail to close completely,
          resulting in a leaky valve, the provider repairs the leak using sutures
          or a patch. A leaky valve allows blood to flow backward into the heart,
          reducing heart function and causing the ventricle to pump harder. The
          ventricle enlarges, causing further loss of function.
    '33535':
        >-
          The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
          grafting in three arterial segments from another location, such as in
          the chest or abdomen, to restore circulation, improve the function of
          the heart, and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33600':
        >-
          The provider patches or sutures an incompetent valve to restore
          appropriate blood flow between the chambers of the heart.
    '33572':
        >-
          The provider accesses the coronary artery during a coronary artery
          bypass graft procedure, incises the artery needing treatment, and
          removes plaque as necessary. Plaque reduces blood flow in the coronary
          arteries and may break off and lodge in a narrow portion. This causes
          complete obstruction of the artery, resulting in an infarction and
          damage to the ventricle.
    '33606':
        >-
          The provider joins the pulmonary artery to the aorta to correct a
          congenital deformity called double inlet ventricle in which the patient
          has only one functional ventricle, the left, which both the aorta and
          the pulmonary artery enter. The procedure reduces excessive blood flow
          into the ventricle.
    '33530':
        >-
          The provider repeats a\_coronary artery bypass grafting procedure or valve procedure more than one month after the original surgery primarily due to failure of the original procedure.
    '33534':

          of the heart, and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33533':
        >-
          The provider diverts blood flow from a damaged vessel in the heart by
          grafting in a single segment of an artery from another location, such as
          in the chest or abdomen, to restore circulation, improve the function of
          the heart, and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33608':
        >-
          The provider uses a variety of surgical techniques, such as tube grafts
          or conduits, to repair heart defects unrelated to pulmonary artery
          narrowing or a ventricular septal defect. The provider connects the
          ventricle to the pulmonary artery.
    '33523':
        >-
          The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by

          that includes both venous and arterial grafting. He performs the
          procedure to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart, and
          decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33542':
        >-
          The provider opens and removes an aneurysm sac from the wall of a
          ventricle of the heart and sutures the defect closed to strengthen the
          heart wall and prevent rupture of the aneurysm, typically during a
          coronary artery bypass graft procedure.
    '33610':
        >-
          The provider surgically enlarges a ventricular septal defect, an
          abnormal opening in the wall between the left and right ventricles that
          did not close at birth or soon after. He places a valved device to
          regulate the amount of blood flow out of the ventricle and correct the
          restriction of blood flow through the ventricular outlet.
    '33641':
        >-
          The provider performs surgical closure of an atrial septal defect by
          opening up the atrium and closing the defect with a patch under direct
          visualization of the area.
    '33670':
        >-
          Cardiac surgery is used to repair defects of the septa and valves of the
          heart. This is usually performed by using sutures and patches of Dacron®
          or pericardium. A prosthetic valve may also be used to replace the
          defective valve.
    '33612':
        >-
          The provider places an intraventricular tunnel graft from the aorta to
          the ventricular septal defect (VSD), to reroute blood flow. When the
          tunnel graft obstructs blood flow through the ventricular outflow tract,
          he repairs the outflow tract with a patch graft.
    '33681':
        >-
          The provider closes a hole in the septum (wall) between the ventricles
          with a patch or sutures to prevent the mixing of oxygenated and
          deoxygenated blood.
    '33617':
        >-
          The provider directly connects the superior vena cava to the pulmonary
          artery, allowing blood flow to bypass the atrium. She may create a
          dividing wall in the atrium to improve the flow of blood to the superior
          vena cava opening.
    '33615':
        >-
          The provider closes an atrial septal defect, or hole in the wall between
          the atria, with a patch graft. He then anastomoses, or connects, the
          pulmonary artery to either the atria or vena cava to correct tricuspid
          atresia, or congenital absence of the opening between the right atrium
          and the right ventricle.
    '33645':
        >-
          The provider closes a sinus venosus defect directly or with a patch in a
          patient with or without anomalous pulmonary venous drainage.
    '33647':
        >-
          The provider closes a hole or defect in the atrial and ventricular septa
          (walls) using stitches or a patch of Dacron® or pericardium to prevent
          the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood into different chambers
          of the heart.
    '33611':
        >-
          The provider places a tunnel graft using artificial graft material
          between the ventricular septal defect, an abnormal opening in the wall
          between the left and right ventricles, and the aorta, to redirect blood
          flow into the aorta.
    '33684':
        >-
          The provider closes a hole in the septum (wall) between the ventricles
          with a patch or sutures to prevent the mixing of oxygenated and
          deoxygenated blood. He incises the pulmonary valve leaflets at their
          junction and removes anything obstructing blood flow through the
          ventricular outflow tract.
    '33665':
        >-
          An atrioventricular (AV) canal defect is repaired by closing the hole in
          the cardiac septa that causes mixing of blood inside the heart chambers.
          Valve competence also needs to be restored. Based on the severity of the
          defect, sometimes the valve is replaced with a mechanical or tissue
          valve.
    '33660':
        >-
          The provider closes a "hole" in the wall between the atria and
          ventricles by suturing the area or by using a patch made of Dacron®
          material or pericardium. Based on the severity of valve defect, the
          tricuspid and mitral valves are also repaired while making sure that the
          valve leaflets are properly placed.
    '33690':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider places a band, made of a material such
          as umbilical tape, to reduce pulmonary blood flow, protect pulmonary
          vessels, and prepare the heart for more definitive procedures in the
          future.The provider places a pulmonary artery band around the
          aortopulmonary trunk, aorta, and pulmonary artery to restrict pulmonary
          blood flow and prevent enlargement of the ventricle and elevation of
          blood pressure in the pulmonary artery.
    '33688':
        >-
          The provider closes a hole in the septum (wall) between the ventricles
          with a patch or sutures to prevent the mixing of oxygenated and
          deoxygenated blood. He removes a pulmonary artery band from a previous
          surgery to temporarily treat a ventricular septal defect. He may add a
          gusset to reinforce the patch on the pulmonary artery.
    '33619':
        >-
          The provider typically performs a Norwood procedure as the first stage
          of several operations to repair aortic arch hypoplasia, or hypoplastic
          left heart syndrome (HLHS). In HLHS, the left ventricle fails to develop
          sufficiently along with the aorta and mitral valve.
    '33736':
        >-
          The provider removes the atrial septum or he intentionally creates an
          opening in the atrial septum, a wall of tissue separating the right and
          left atrium of the heart. This is an open heart surgery, meaning that he
          places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass to perform this service.
    '33692':
        >-
          The provider repairs tetralogy of Fallot by placing a patch graft to
          close off a ventricular septal defect and removing muscle from the
          infundibulum to correct right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
    '33710':
        >-
          The provider surgically repairs a sinus of Valsalva fistula, an abnormal
          connection between the aortic sinus, or a structural dilation in the
          ascending aorta, and the heart. He also repairs a ventricular septal
          defect, or a hole in the tissue wall separating the two ventricles. The
          provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass during the
          procedure.
    '33720':
        >-
          The provider surgically repairs a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, an
          abnormal bulge in the aortic sinus, or a structural dilation in the
          ascending aorta. The provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary
          bypass during the procedure.
    '33755':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the
          ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. A shunt forms the bypass
          channel or passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood
          vessels and diverts blood from one region to the other. The aim of this
          procedure is to improve oxygenation of the blood in a patient with
          cyanosis from insufficient pulmonar blood flow due to a congenital heart
          defect. This procedure is also known as Waterston type operation.
    '33730':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider incises the chest wall and performs a
          complete repair of an anomalous pulmonary venous return, a congenital
          condition in which all four pulmonary veins fail to reach the left
          atrium of the heart; instead they drain oxygenated blood from the lungs
          into the right atrium of the heart. This condition is usually associated
          with an atrial septal defect, a hole in the tissue wall that separates
          the right and left atrium.
    '33697':
        >-
          The provider closes off the ventricular septal defect with a patch graft
          and places a tube graft between the right ventricle and pulmonary
          artery. This bypasses the obstruction of blood flow that the
          underdevelopment or absence of the pulmonary valve causes.
    '33735':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider removes the atrial septum or he
          intentionally creates an opening in the atrial septum, the wall of
          tissue separating the right and left atrium of the heart.
    '33732':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cor triatriatum or
          a supravalvular mitral ring defect by removing the excess membrane that
          restricts the flow of blood. A cor triatriatum is a congenital anomaly
          in which the left or right atrium is divided into two compartments by a
          fold of tissue, also referred to as a triatrial heart. A supravalvular
          mitral ring is a congenital defect in which an abnormal membrane of
          tissue on the atrial side of the mitral valve restricts the flow of
          blood from the left atrium to the left ventricle.
    '33762':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the descending aorta and the pulmonary artery. A shunt forms the bypass channel or passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood vessels and diverts blood from one region to the other. The aim of this procedure is to improve oxygenation of the blood in a patient with cyanosis from insufficient pulmonary blood flow due to a congenital heart defect. \_This procedure is also known as Potts Smith type operation.
    '33750':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the
          subclavian and the pulmonary artery. A shunt forms the bypass channel or
          passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood vessels and
          diverts blood from one region to the other. The aim of this procedure is
          to improve oxygenation of the blood in a patient with cyanosis from
          insufficient pulmonary, or lung, blood flow due to a congenital heart
          defect. The provider performs this procedure as a temporary measure
          until he can perform another procedure to correct the actual heart
          defect. This procedure is also known as a Blalock Taussig operation.
    '33737':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider removes the atrial septum or he intentionally creates an opening in the atrial septum, a wall of tissue separating the right and left atrium of the heart. This is an open heart surgery, meaning that he places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass to perform this service. He also performs inflow occlusion, meaning that he covers the vena cavae and the azygous vein\_with tourniquets\_to temporarily\_interrupt the venous blood returning to the heart and provide a brief period of complete\_circulatory arrest.
    '33702':
        >-
          The provider closes off a fistula (abnormal passageway) between the
          sinus of Valsalva and one of the coronary arteries to prevent rupture.
    '33694':
        >-
          The provider repairs tetralogy of Fallot by closing off the ventricular
          septal defect with a patch. She removes muscle tissue to restore blood
          flow through the ventricular outflow tract if necessary. She also
          enlarges the pulmonary anulus with a patch graft to correct narrowing of
          the pulmonary valve.
    '33775':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect
          present from birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle
          and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, by constructing
          a baffle or tunnel from the pericardium or the atrial valve that directs
          the deoxygenated blood to the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery,
          and directs the oxygenated blood to the right ventricle and aorta. The
          provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, during the
          procedure. The provider also removes a band from around the pulmonary
          artery that was placed during a previous surgery.This procedure is also
          known as a Mustard or Senning type procedure.
    '33780':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a\_cardiac defect present since birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. The pulmonary artery is normally located in the right ventricle and the aorta is located in the left ventricle. The provider switches the transposed or abnormally attached pulmonary artery and aorta. The provider also performs the closure of a ventricular septal defect, or a defect in the tissue wall separating the two ventricles.\_This procedure is also known as an arterial switch or Jatene procedure.
    '33767':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the
          superior vena cava and the right pulmonary artery diverting deoxygenated
          blood directly to both the lungs. A shunt forms the bypass channel or
          passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood vessels and
          diverting blood from one region to the other. The provider performs this
          procedure so that blood bypasses the defective right chamber of the
          heart and reaches directly into the lungs through the pulmonary artery
          for oxygenation. This procedure is also known as bidirectional Glenn
          procedure.
    '33779':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect
          present since birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle
          and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. The pulmonary
          artery is normally located in the right ventricle and the aorta is
          located in the left ventricle. The provider switches the transposed or
          abnormally attached pulmonary artery and aorta. The provider also
          removes a pulmonary band that might have been placed during a previous
          surgery.This procedure is also known as an arterial switch or Jatene
          procedure.
    '33786':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider creates a tunnel giving the left
          ventricle the job of pumping blood to the body. The provider corrects or
          repairs a condition known as truncus arteriosus, or a defect present
          from birth in which one large blood vessel leads out of the heart, where
          normally there are two separate vessels coming out of the heart.
    '33770':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider repairs a cardiac defect present from
          birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the
          pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This causes problems in
          circulation of oxygenated blood in the body. The provider switches the
          aorta and the pulmonary artery to their normal positions without the
          need to enlarge the hole in the ventricular septum. The provider also
          removes an obstructive band of fibrous muscle present at the tip of
          pulmonary artery.
    '33788':
        >-
          The provider repairs and reimplants a pulmonary artery with an existing
          defect. The provider commonly performs this procedure for repair of
          anomalous, or abnormal, origin of the pulmonary artery.
    '33776':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect present since birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, by constructing a baffle or tunnel from the pericardium or the atrial valve that directs the deoxygenated blood to the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery and directs the oxygenated blood to the right ventricle and aorta. The provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass during this procedure. The provider also performs the closure of a ventricular septal defect, or a defect in the tissue wall separating the two ventricles.\_This procedure is also known as a Mustard or Senning type procedure.
    '33764':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the
          aorta and the main pulmonary artery. A shunt forms the bypass channel or
          passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood vessels and
          diverts blood from one region to the other. The aim of this procedure is
          to improve oxygenation of the blood in a patient with cyanosis from
          insufficient pulmonary blood flow due to a congenital heart defect.
    '33777':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect
          present since birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle
          and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, by constructing
          a baffle or tunnel from the pericardium or the atrial valve that directs
          the deoxygenated blood to the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery
          and directs the oxygenated blood to right ventricle and aorta. The
          provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass. The provider also
          repairs a subpulmonic obstruction, or an obstruction in the pulmonary
          artery caused by a band of fibrous tissue at the junction of the right
          ventricle with the pulmonary artery. This procedure is also known as a
          Mustard or Senning type procedure.
    '33778':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect
          present since birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle
          and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. The pulmonary
          artery is normally located in the right ventricle and the aorta is
          located in the left ventricle. The provider switches the transposed, or
          abnormally attached, pulmonary artery and aorta. This procedure is also
          known as an arterial switch or Jatene procedure.
    '33774':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect
          present from birth, by constructing a baffle or tunnel from the
          pericardium or the atrial wall that directs the deoxygenated blood to
          the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery, and directs the oxygenated
          blood to the right ventricle and the aorta. The provider places the
          patient on cardiopulmonary bypass during this procedure. This procedure
          is also called a Mustard or Senning procedure.
    '33781':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider repairs a cardiac defect present from
          birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the
          pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This causes problems in
          circulation of oxygenated blood in the body. The provider switches the
          aorta and the pulmonary artery to their normal positions and moves the
          coronary arteries to the new aorta. The provider also removes an
          obstructive band of fibrous muscle present at the tip of the pulmonary
          artery.
    '33766':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the
          superior vena cava and the right pulmonary artery. A shunt forms the
          bypass channel or passageway in the blood circulation connecting two
          blood vessels and diverts blood from one region to the other. The
          provider performs this procedure so that blood bypasses the defective
          right chamber of the heart and reaches directly into one lung through
          the pulmonary artery for oxygenation. This procedure is also known as
          classical Glenn procedure.
    '33771':
        >-

          present from birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle
          and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. The patient
          also has a ventricular septal defect that he must enlarge the hole in
          septum during the procedure and use a graft to connect the left
          ventricle to the aorta through this hole. In this procedure the provider
          must also repair a narrowing of the pulmonary artery, a blood vessel
          that carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs
          for purification.
    '33851':
        >-
          The provider excises tissues, which are narrowing the aorta of the
          patient. He may also repair a patent ductus arteriosus if present. For

          the gastrointestinal tract.
    '36833':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically opens an autogenous or
          nonautogenous arteriovenous fistula and revises the connection between
          the artery and the vein. An arteriovenous fistula is a connection
          between an artery and a vein, often located in the upper arm or forearm
          that a provider uses for dialysis purposes. He also performs a
          thrombectomy, or removal of a thrombus, or blood clot.
    '36835':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider inserts an arteriovenous shunt between an artery and vein. He most often places this shunt in a patient who will receive hemodialysis treatments. \_Hemodialysis is a process in which a dialysis machine removes harmful wastes, salt, and fluids from the blood and reinfuses the purified blood back into the patient's circulation.
    '36838':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider uses distal revascularization and
          interval ligation, or DRIL, to surgically correct a dialysis access

          mouth (oro–) of the patient into the stomach via the mouth and
          esophagus. The physician may use radiological guidance to advance the
          tube to the stomach. This procedure is mainly done to aspirate stomach
          contents for diagnostic or therapeutic purpose, to prevent aspiration
          and vomiting in trauma patients, and for enteral feeding. For patients
          with poisoning or drug overdose, the tube is used to remove the harmful
          substance from the body by draining the contents of the stomach. The
          tube is connected to a syringe or a suction pump at the external open

        >-
          The provider creates a small gastric reservoir using the upper portion
          of the stomach and connects it to the small intestine. In doing so, he
          bypasses the main body of the stomach, effectively restricting the
          amount of food a patient can consume at one time and also limiting
          absorption. He performs the procedure to treat morbid obesity.
    '43652':
        >-

    '43848':
        >-
          The provider either enlarges or reduces the size of the stomach pouch
          previously created during a gastric restrictive procedure. The provider
          reduces the size of the pouch if the patient did not experience
          sufficient weight loss. If the patient has experienced vomiting or
          severe malabsorption of nutrients, the provider enlarges the size of the
          pouch. He performs this procedure in patients who have not have an
          adjustable band placed below the stomach pouch.

        >-
          The provider examines the entire upper digestive tract except for the
          ileum, the most distal portion of the small intestine. He destroys any
          tumors, polyps, or other lesions that he finds using laser or
          radiofrequency energy rather than other forms of ablation. The lesions
          are most likely benign but could be precancerous or obstructing the
          small intestine.
    '44322':
        >-
          In this procedure the provider pulls a small loop of the large
          intestine, either from the colon or cecum, to an incision in the
          abdominal wall, incises the intestinal segment, and stitches it to the
          abdominal wall. He does this to provide direct access to the intestines,
          typically for emptying them. He also collects multiple biopsy samples
          along the length of the intestine.
    '44360':
        >-
          The provider examines a portion of the small intestine for abnormalities

          which he inserts through the mouth. He includes the first and second
          parts of the duodenum and into the jejunum, but he excludes the ileum,
          the terminal portion of the small intestine, to look for a cause for
          gastrointestinal symptom such as bleeding and diarrhea. He takes samples
          of any suspicious tissue by brushing or washing the area to collect
          cells for laboratory analysis.

        >-
          The provider examines the entire upper digestive tract except for the
          ileum, the most distal portion of the small intestine. He places a
          jejunostomy tube through the endoscope into the jejunum and brings it
          out through a stab incision in the abdomen. The provider performs these
          procedures to provide the patient with nutritional support, typically to
          allow healing of the esophagus or stomach from disease or prior surgery.
    '44370':
        >-
          The provider examines the entire upper digestive tract except for the
          ileum, the most distal portion of the small intestine. He dilates the

          The provider passes an endoscope through the anus and examines a
          previously created small intestinal pouch and the anastomosis, the
          connection between the ileal pouch and the anus. If he sees any areas of
          abnormal mucosa or tissue, he takes samples using a brush passed through
          the scope or irrigates the area with warm saline and aspirates the
          washings through the scope. He sends the specimens to the laboratory for
          diagnostic analysis.
    '44376':
        >-
          The provider performs a visual examination of the upper gastrointestinal
          tract using a lighted endoscope. He examines the entire upper digestive
          tract from the esophagus to the ileum. If he finds anything suspicious,
          he collects specimens by passing a brushlike device through the
          endoscope and brushing the mucosa or the lining of the digestive tract
          or by instilling warm water and suctioning it out through the endoscope.
          He sends the specimens to the pathology laboratory for histopathologic
          examination.

    '50770':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider excises and takes away a blocked or
          injured potion of the ureter and then joins the renal end of the
          remaining portion of the ureter to the healthy ureter on the other side
          of the body. The provider performs this procedure primarily if the
          length of the remaining ureter after removing the blocked or injured
          part is insufficient for anastomosis to the bladder.
    '50728':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider revises an artificial opening, or stoma,
          between the skin and the urinary tract that he previously creates. He
          also repairs a defect in the fascia, or the fibrous tissue surrounding
          the anastomosis, and or a hernia, or rupture of the ureteral tissue. He
          revises the opening based on the type of urostomy, which may be between
          the skin and the ureter, bladder, colon segment, or kidney.
    '50760':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider excises and takes away a blocked portion
          of the ureter and then rejoins the two ends of the healthy ureter. The
          provider performs this procedure primarily to remove the blocked or
          injured part of the ureter.
    '50783':
        >-

        >-
          In this procedure, the provider revises an artificial opening, or stoma
          between the skin and the urinary tract that he previously creates. He
          revises the opening based on the type of urostomy, which may be between
          the skin and the ureter, bladder, colon segment, or kidney. The provider
          performs this procedure because of a defect in the urinary or renal
          collecting system such as a blockage of the stoma, rupture, or other
          defect in the urinary tract.
    '50725':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider frees a ureter from a ureteral
          obstruction due to a retrocaval ureter, a rare congenital anomaly in
          which the ureter passes behind the inferior vena cava. The provider uses
          one of two approaches to repair the anomaly. He may dissect the ureter
          to repair the retrocaval ureter or he dissects the vena cava into two
          ends, repositions the ureter in front, and reanastomoses, or surgically
          reconnects the vena cava. A retrocaval ureter is also known as a
          circumcaval ureter.
    '50715':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically frees the ureter from fibrous
          bands of inflamed tissues of the retroperitoneum, or the space between

    '50785':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically transplants the ureter to a
          different site in the urinary bladder to allow an uninterrupted flow of
          urine. He connects the ureter to the new opening in the bladder by
          suturing the bladder and psoas or by harvesting a long, elliptical flap
          from the bladder roof.
    '50782':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider detaches the ureter on one end, cuts off
          any diseased portion, and attaches the remaining portion back to the
          bladder. Providers perform this procedure on patients with a duplicated
          ureter, typically a congenital condition involving either two ureters
          arising from a single kidney and draining urine into the bladder after
          combining into one, or one ureter draining into the bladder and another
          into supporting structures like the vagina, urethra, etc.
    '50740':
        >-

          which is the upper portion of the ureter.
    '50810':
        >-
          The provider creates a bladder structure out of an excised part of the
          sigmoid colon, inserts the ureters into it, and attaches the structure
          to allow passage of the patient’s urine through an artificially created
          outlet in the abdomen or perineum. Providers typically perform this
          procedure on patients whose urinary bladder has been taken out due to
          cancer or other reasons.
    '50948':
        >-

          device, such as a thread, wire, or constricting band placed on the
          ureter during a previous surgery to control the flow of urine due to
          urinary incontinence. It may also occur as a result of accidental
          retention of surgical a device.
    '50820':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider cuts a portion of the intestine known as
          the ileum, closes it from one end to form a pouch, sutures the ureter to
          divert urine into the ileal pouch, and connects the other end of the
          ileal pouch to the abdominal wall to create an external opening for
          outflow of urine. He then sutures the cut ends of the intestine together
          to reestablish bowel continuity. He primarily performs this procedure to
          facilitate urine excretion following surgical removal of the urinary
          bladder due to severe trauma or malignancy.
    '50845':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider cuts a portion of the intestine known as
          the appendix, joins one end to the urinary bladder to divert urine into
          the bladder, and connects the other end to the abdominal wall to create
          an external opening for outflow of urine. He then sutures the cut ends
          of the intestine together to reestablish bowel continuity. He primarily
          performs this procedure to facilitate urine excretion following
          neurogenic or congenital dysfunction of the urinary bladder.

          from the ureter.
    '50815':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider cuts the colon, makes a small incision
          on it, and attaches a ureter to the incision. He stitches the colon end
          onto the abdominal wall and creates an artificial opening to the outside
          of the body to allow the passage of urine. The provider attaches the
          remaining portion of colon back with the intestine to maintain
          continuity. Providers typically perform this procedure on patients whose
          urinary bladder has been taken out due to cancer or other reasons.
    '50947':
        >-
          The provider reimplants the ureter into the bladder using a laparoscopic
          approach. The procedure includes the use of a laparoscope, and
          cystoscope, or endoscope, to examine the bladder and lower urinary tract
          and the placement of a stent. The procedure is done to treat ureteral
          injury, stricture, and/or obstruction.
    '50949':

          have a specific code.
    '50900':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider stitches a crack or discontinuity in the
          wall of the ureter. The provider may perform this primarily to regain
          the patency of the lumen following injury or surgical removal of stones
          within the ureter.
    '50920':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider surgically removes a ureterocutaneous
          fistula, or an abnormal connection between the skin and the ureter.

          internal organ.
    '50825':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider creates a pouch or other reservoir with
          a section cut from the small or large intestine. The provider sutures
          the ureters to the reservoir so that urine drains through the ureters
          into the reservoir. From there urine is excreted outside. The provider
          typically performs this procedure after the removal of the bladder.
    '50840':
        >-
          The provider performs a surgical procedure using a section of an
          intestine to replace all, or part, of the duct that passes urine from
          the kidney to the bladder. The procedure is indicated for conditions
          such as, recurring stones, ureteral cancer, and extensive ureteral
          injury.

          The bulbourethral glands are a pair of pea–sized exocrine glands located
          at the base of the penis, lateral and parallel to the urethra, in the
          deep perineal pouch, surrounded by the fascial layers of the sphincter
          urethrae membranaceae muscle. They connect to the urethra through a
          single excretory duct at the base of the penis. The glands are
          responsible for pre–ejaculatory secretion of a clear, viscous seminal
          fluid that helps clean and lubricate the urethra while neutralizing the
          acidity of the urethra for the smooth passing of the semen. The glands
          also produce a small amount of prostate–specific antigen. The Cowper's
          glands may be excised for malignancy or other abnormality such as cysts
          in the gland (Cowper's syringocele) or infection. Diagnostic procedures

          attending provider. The consulting provider monitors the fetus during
          labor by supervising or personally attaching an electrode to the fetus
          and performing the monitoring and interpretation of the results in a
          written report to the attending provider. Report this code to represent
          the imaging supervision and interpretation for this procedure.

          In this procedure, the provider evaluates fetal responses to inducing
          contractions in the mother to determine if the fetus can tolerate labor.
    '59070':
        >-
          The provider introduces a warm fluid into the uterus to increase the
          amount of amniotic fluid in case of oligohydramnios or anhydramnios
          (scanty or absent amniotic fluid) or to enhance the ability to see fetal
          anomalies. The provider performs this procedure via a transabdominal
          approach using ultrasound guidance.
    '58976':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider transfers a gamete, zygote, or embryo
          directly into the fallopian tube using a catheter.
    '59030':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider takes a sample of fetal blood from the
          fetus’s scalp to find out if the fetus is getting enough oxygen during
          labor.
    '59074':
        >-
          The provider drains excess fluid that has accumulated in the bladder,
          lungs, or abdominal cavity of the fetus. The provider uses a
          transabdominal approach and ultrasound guidance to perform this
          procedure.
    '59051':
        >-
          A provider performs the interpretation of this fetal monitoring service
          that is other than the attending provider. The consulting provider

          labor, and interprets the results in a written report to the attending
          provider.
    '59001':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider inserts a needle through the patient’s
          abdominal wall into the fetal amniotic sac to withdraw excess amniotic
          fluid to treat a condition known as polyhydramnios. The provider uses
          real time ultrasound scanning to perform this service.
    '59012':
        >-
          The provider uses a needle and different methods, such as a
          transplacental or a transamniotic approach, to remove blood from the
          fetal umbilical cord to diagnoses various blood conditions and
          infections in the fetus.
    '59015':
        >-

          The provider performs this procedure for advanced stage twin–to–twin
          fetal transfusion syndrome to terminate the fetus that will not survive
          and ensure survival of the coexisting normal fetus. The provider
          performs this procedure via a transabdominal approach using ultrasound
          guidance.
    '59120':
        >-
          The provider removes the fallopian tube or ovary, or both, to treat an
          ectopic pregnancy. There may be a large fetus imbedded around the ovary
          or in the fallopian tube or an ectopic pregnancy may have already
          ruptured the fallopian tube. In either circumstance, the provider
          determines that he must remove the fallopian tube or ovary or both. The
          provider performs this procedure abdominally or vaginally.
    '59200':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider inserts a drug or device that dilates
          the cervix prior to a gynecological procedure that requires entry into

          In this procedure, the provider makes a hole or incision into the
          fallopian tube and or ovary to remove a small ectopic pregnancy from
          that location, or removes a fetus that is within the pelvic cavity or
          imbedded within the cornu of the uterus, or the points where the uterus
          and fallopian tubes meet, also known as the uterine horns. The provider
          performs this procedure using a laparoscope. The provider does not
          remove the fallopian tube or ovary.
    '59136':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider removes an ectopic pregnancy that is

          first position prior to delivery. The provider may use drugs to suppress
          contractions while he performs the procedure. The provider maneuvers the
          fetus with his hands on the woman’s abdomen.
    '59426':
        >-
          This service is considered a mini global code for the provider who
          provides seven or more antepartum visits. This can happen when the
          patient transfers out of the practice prior to delivery or the pregnancy
          terminates prior to delivery. In some cases, the provider must use this
          code when he does not provide all of the antepartum care, but does
          perform the delivery with or without postpartum care because the patient
          transfers in from another practice and the payer does not allow the
          physician to report the global services code, such as 59400.

        >-
          This service is considered a mini global code for the provider who
          provides only four to six of the patient’s antepartum visits. This can
          happen when the patient transfers out of the practice prior to delivery
          or the pregnancy terminates prior to delivery. In some cases, the
          provider must use this code when he does not provide all of the
          antepartum care, but does perform the delivery with or without
          postpartum care because the patient transfers in from another practice,
          and the payer does not allow the provider to bill a global services code

    '61312':
        >-
          Hematoma is an unusual collection of blood outside the blood vessels due
          to internal hemorrhage. Subdural or extradural hematoma is caused by
          head injuries, and it is a life–threatening condition. These hematomas
          can be removed through suction, for which the physician has to perform
          an incision of the scalp, craniotomy, or craniectomy. A supratentorial
          hematoma is the accumulation of blood in the region above the tentorium
          cerebella (or the cerebellar tentorium –– the extended dura mater that
          surrounds and separates the cerebellum from the other parts of brain in
          the posterior cerebral hemisphere).
    '61151':

          In this procedure, the provider incises the skull and opens the cranium
          to repair a leak of cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, which occurs as a
          result of a break in the dura, the outer membrane covering the brain.
          The dural repair also resolves drainage of CSF through the nose or the
          ear.
    '62000':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider makes a burr hole in the scalp and
          elevates the depressed skull fracture, meaning a portion of skull bone
          moved inward into the brain. It is a closed fracture that has not
          reached the dura, the outer membrane covering the brain.
    '62165':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider uses a small neuroendoscope to access
          the pituitary gland to remove an abnormal growth of the gland. The
          provider approaches this procedure through the nasal cavity or through
          the sphenoidal sinuses.
    '62164':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider uses a small endoscope to access the
          brain to remove a brain tumor. The provider also places a ventricular
          catheter for external drainage.
    '62180':
        >-
          In a patient with a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain
          ventricles, the provider places a shunt to move the fluid from a lateral
          ventricle to the cisterna magna, a space between the cerebellum at the
          brain’s base and the medulla part of the brainstem.
    '62192':
        >-
          In a patient with a buildup of fluid under the arachnoid or dural
          membrane covering the brain, the provider inserts a shunt to drain
          excess cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, either to the abdominal cavity,
          pleural cavity or other terminus, meaning another location to drain. The
          provider performs this service to treat hydrocephalus, an obstruction in
          the flow of CSF, which creates pressure on the brain, also referred to
          as water on the brain.
    '62147':
        >-
          The provider repairs a skull bone defect larger than 5 cm by using bone tissue harvested from another part of the patient and transferred to the cranium. \_This service resolves cranial defects as a result of depressed skull fractures, congenital abnormalities, tumors, or other trauma or disease.
    '62200':
        >-
          The provider performs a ventriculocisternostomy, creating an artificial
          opening in the floor of the third ventricle of the brain to the cisterna
          magna, one of three principal openings in the subarachnoid space where
          cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, drains. The provider performs this
          procedure to treat hydrocephalus, most often a form known as
          noncommunicating hydrocephalus to allow CSF to drain inside the
          patient’s body.
    '62201':
        >-
          The provider uses a small endoscope to access the brain, along with
          stereotactic imaging guidance, to perform a ventriculocisternostomy. In
          this procedure, the provider creates an artificial opening in the floor
          of the third ventricle of the brain to the cisterna magna, one of three
          principal openings in the subarachnoid space where cerebrospinal fluid,
          or CSF, drains. The provider performs this procedure to treat
          hydrocephalus; most often a form known as noncommunicating hydrocephalus
          to allow CSF to drain inside the patient’s body.
    '62194':
        >-
          In a patient with a failed or malfunctioning cerebrospinal fluid shunt,
          the provider restores proper function by replacing or flushing a
          catheter that begins in the subarachnoid or subdural space under the
          brain’s protective membranes.
    '62161':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider uses a small endoscope to access the
          brain to remove adhesions or a cyst located on the septum pellucidum or
          a cyst within one of the ventricles. The provider also places, replaces,
          or removes a ventricular catheter used for a shunt system or for
          external drainage.
    '62190':
        >-
          In a patient with a buildup of fluid under the arachnoid or dural
          membrane covering the brain, the provider inserts a shunt to drain the
          fluid either to the heart’s atrial chamber, the jugular vein, or the
          heart’s auricle.
    '62220':
        >-
          The provider creates a shunt, or tube, leading from the ventricles of
          the brain to the atria, jugular veins, or auricular processes to drain
          excess cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. Providers perform the procedure to
          treat diseases, such as hydrocephalus, where the ventricles enlarge with
          CSF. The provider may use an endoscope to perform the procedure.
    '62160':
        >-
          In this add on procedure, the provider uses a small endoscope to access
          the brain to place or replace a ventricular catheter for a shunt system
          or for external drainage. This service is performed as an initial
          placement to drain cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, from the ventricles of
          the brain and reduce pressure, or the provider replaces a catheter due
          to a blockage in the flow of the CSF.
    '62162':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider uses a small endoscope to access the brain \_to remove, or create an opening to drain, a colloid cyst, a thick, gel like benign tumor typically found in the third ventricle. The provider also places \_a ventricular catheter for external drainage.
    '62148':
        >-
          In this add on procedure, the provider incises and retrieves a cranial
          bone graft that was previously stored in a subcutaneous pocket in the
          abdomen or in the inner lining of the scalp near the site of the defect
          to preserve the graft and reduce graft devitalization. The provider then
          uses the stored graft to repair the skull bone defect in a procedure
          called a cranioplasty.
    '62270':
        >-
          In this diagnostic procedure, the provider obtains a sample of the
          cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for examination. The provider commonly
          performs this procedure to rule out meningitis.
    '62264':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider places a catheter or introduces a
          chemical substance to an adhesion in the epidural space to remove the
          adhesion, in a procedure often referred to as a Racz catheter procedure
          or epidural neurolysis. The provider uses imaging to identify the site
          of the adhesions and the procedure occurs over more than one session on
          the same day.
    '62258':
        >-
          The provider removes a shunt system for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid,
          or CSF, and then replaces it with a similar or other shunt system during
          the same operative procedure. Providers may perform the procedure when
          all three components of the system require replacement or for an
          infection of the shunt.
    '62269':
        >-
          The provider inserts a needle into the spinal cord to collect a sample
          of tissue for testing.
    '62230':
        >-
          The provider replaces or revises a malfunctioning part of a previously
          placed shunt system for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF.
          Providers may perform the procedure due to a blockage in the shunt,
          valve, or distal catheter preventing the CSF from draining. The provider
          may use a neuroendoscope to perform the procedure.
    '62252':
        >-
          The provider reprograms a programmable shunt system, which allows for
          noninvasive adjustments to correct over or under drainage of
          cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF.
    '62256':
        >-
          The provider removes and does not replace a shunt system for drainage of
          cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. Providers may perform the procedure due to
          a malfunction of the system, an infection of the shunt, or for a patient
          who no longer requires the device.
    '62280':
        >-
          The provider injects or infuses a neurolytic, a substance that is used
          to kill a specific nerve or group of nerves, in the subarachnoid space
          of any spinal level. The provider may include another therapeutic drug
          along with the neurolytic. This service helps to eliminate severe pain,
          especially from cancer pain involving the torso.
    '62272':
        >-
          During this procedure, the provider reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
          pressure on the brain. He inserts a hollow needle or catheter into the
          subarachnoid space, usually in the lower back of the spinal column, to
          withdraw CSF. This procedure is also referred to as a spinal tap.
    '62223':
        >-
          The provider places a shunt, or tube, leading from the ventricles of the
          brain to the abdominal cavity, pleural cavity, or other terminus,
          meaning another location to drain. Providers perform the procedure to
          treat diseases, such as hydrocephalus, where the ventricles enlarge with
          CSF and to drain CSF to another area of the body. The provider may use
          an endoscope to perform the procedure.
    '62268':
        >-
          The provider aspirates a cyst or a syrinx of the spinal cord. This
          service is often done as a therapeutic measure to determine whether a
          cyst is causing a patient’s symptoms and decide whether surgery can
          help.
    '62263':
        >-
          The provider places a catheter or introduces a chemical substance to an
          adhesion in the epidural space to remove the adhesion, in a procedure

          The provider uses imaging to identify the site of the adhesions and the
          procedure occurs over more than one session and more than one day.
    '62281':
        >-
          The provider injects or infuses a neurolytic, a substance that is used
          to kill a specific nerve or group of nerves, in the epidural space of
          the cervical or thoracic spinal level. The provider may include another
          therapeutic drug along with the neurolytic. This service helps to
          eliminate severe pain after trauma or surgery involving limb amputation
          or to manage acutely painful conditions such as cancer.
    '62225':
        >-
          The provider replaces or flushes out a previously placed ventricular
          catheter for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. Providers may
          perform the procedure due to a blockage in the catheter preventing the
          CSF from draining. The provider may use an endoscope to perform the
          procedure.
    '62273':
        >-
          The provider injects a patient's own blood to seal a cerebrospinal
          fluid, or CSF, leak that a spinal needle often causes. This service
          treats a post spinal headache which may occur when an epidural, spinal
          needle, or lumbar puncture leaves a hole or tear in the dura, the lining
          around the spinal cord, causing spinal fluid to leak.
    '62350':
        >-
          The provider implants, replaces, or repositions a previously implanted
          and tunneled intrathecal or epidural catheter. This procedure does not
          include a laminectomy. This service is done to instill medication into
          the cerebrospinal fluid using an external or internal reservoir pump
          system to treat many conditions including severe pain after trauma,
          postoperative pain, pain from diseases like cancer, or for other medical
          conditions such as spasticity, a muscle control disorder in which
          muscles are tight or stiff, and they involuntarily spasm.
    '62291':
        >-
          The provider performs this diagnostic procedure, called discography, by
          injecting contrast into the nucleus pulposus, or gel like center of a
          spinal disc, to examine and better visualize the intervertebral disc
          space. This procedure is also referred to as a discogram, or disc
          stimulation, and it helps identify damaged cervical or thoracic
          vertebrae causing neck or back pain.
    '62351':
        >-

        >-
          The provider removes a small amount of the gel like substance in the
          middle of a spinal disc, known as nucleus pulposus. He makes a needle
          puncture through the skin and into the disc. Then he aspirates a small
          amount of disc material between two vertebrae in the lumbar region of
          the spine to relieve pressure on the nerves of the spine. The provider
          uses fluoroscopy or other imaging technique for visualization. The
          procedure may include epidural anesthetic injections to one or more
          treatment levels of the lumbar region.
    '62284':
        >-
          The provider injects contrast into the subarachnoid space of the lumbar

          injecting an enzyme into a lumbar vertebral disc to dissolve the bulging
          nucleus pulposus, or the gel like center of the spinal disc. The
          provider also performs a discography using fluoroscopy to locate the
          disc and determine the exact area where the injection should be given.
          This procedure treats a herniated disc and relieves back pain as a
          result of bulging disc material that is putting pressure on the spinal
          nerve.
    '62282':
        >-
          The provider injects or infuses a neurolytic, a substance that is used
          to kill a specific nerve or group of nerves, in the epidural space of
          the lumbar or sacral spinal level. The provider may include another
          therapeutic drug along with the neurolytic. This service helps to
          eliminate severe pain for painful nerve root compression, where pressure
          is placed on the nerve root, unexplainable or complex recurrent
          postoperative pain, or spasm associated with spasticity or paraplegia.
    '62355':

          The herniation of a cervical disc is one of the most common causes of
          cervical pain (cervicalgia or neck pain). Herniation occurs when an
          intervertebral disc moves out of its place, there is a tear in the
          annulus of the cervical disc caused by an accident or pathological
          causes, and the nucleus pulposus (the gelatinous substance inside the
          spinal disc) bulges out. A herniated disc puts pressure on the nerve
          roots or spinal cord and causes pain in the patient. When medication
          fails, herniation needs surgical intervention. The surgeon decompresses
          the nerve roots/spinal cord by removing the herniated portion of the
          disc. Grafts are used to fill the empty space created by the removal of
          the disc.
    '63078':
        >-
          In this add on procedure, the provider repairs another herniated

          Neuroplasty or transposition of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel is
          done to treat a condition called carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The
          carpal tunnel is a narrow tunnel in the wrist through which the median
          nerve and nine flexor tendons of the hand pass. The tendons include the
          four flexor digitorum superficialis tendons, four flexor digitorum
          profundus tendons, and one flexor pollicis longus tendon. The top of the
          tunnel over the median nerve is covered by the transverse carpal
          ligament. Inflammation of any of these tendons results in the
          compression of the median nerve or CTS in which the patient feels
          numbness and weakness of the muscles in the hand. CTS may be caused due
          to disease conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, acromegaly,
          hypothyroidism, and amyloidosis; or due to work–related conditions that
          require repetitive movement of fingers such as working long hours on
          computer keyboards or playing keyboard instruments like the piano.

    '66761':
        >-
          The provider uses a laser beam to create a small hole in the iris that
          equalizes the intraocular pressure between anterior and posterior
          chamber of the eyes. Report this code for single session of laser beam
          application. Providers perform this procedure to lower the intraocular
          pressure.

        >-
          The provider excises a lesion on the ciliary body of the eye by removing
          part of the iris, cornea, and or sclera.
    '66500':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider makes a puncture like opening in the
          iris to decrease pressure in the eye due to a blockage that is
          preventing the aqueous fluid from draining out of a patient’s eye. This
          condition results in a form of glaucoma known as angle closure glaucoma.
    '66740':
        >-
          The provider separates part of the ciliary body to decrease fluid
          production in the eye and, in turn, decrease intraocular pressure.

          membranous cataract.
    '66983':
        >-
          The provider removes the cataract lens and capsule as one and then
          inserts a lens prosthesis. The goal of the procedure is to correct a
          cataract, an opacity of the lens that affects the vision of the eye.
    '66770':
        >-
          The provider uses non excisional techniques, such as fine needle
          aspiration or laser beam, to destroy the cyst or lesion in the iris or
          ciliary body of the eye.
    '66850':
        >-
          The provider uses mechanical or ultrasonic methods to break down the
          lens material and remove it from the eye to treat a cataract, which
          obscures the patient’s vision. He aspirates the material throughout the
          process.

          may also remove vitreous humor during the procedure.
    '66762':
        >-
          The provider passes laser beam through the iris which alters its
          configuration and results in an increase in angle width and vision
          improvement.
    '66825':
        >-
          The provider adjusts the already positioned intraocular lens prosthesis
          keeping the intraocular pressure intact.
    '66982':
        >-
          The provider inserts an intraocular lens prosthesis after extracapsular
          cataract extraction using complex techniques and devices. He may perform
          this by means of an iris expansion device, providing support to the
          intraocular lens, or capsulorrhexis. This procedure is done without the

          during artificial lens implantation through continuous aspiration. This
          procedure may be done in one or more stages.
    '67010':
        >-
          The provider removes most of the vitreous humor, the gelatinous material
          that gives shape to the eye, to provide access to the retina or to
          remove material within the vitreous that obstructs vision. He accesses
          the vitreous anteriorly, or from the front of the eye, through the
          limbus or cornea, and uses mechanical tools to remove the vitreous.
    '67005':
        >-
          The provider removes a portion of vitreous humor, the gelatinous
          material that gives shape to the eye, to provide access to the retina or

          Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive medical test that
          helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions .MR imaging uses
          a magnetic field, radio frequency pulses and uses the natural magnetic
          properties of the hydrogen atoms in our body that emit radiofrequency
          signals when exposed to radio waves in an electro–magnetic field. A

          Radiation therapy is one of the most effective treatment methods for
          cancerous tumors. Due to its negative side effects like damage to the
          healthy cells, radiation therapy involves thorough planning of the
          dosage, the method, and the duration of the treatment. Dosimetry refers
          to the calculation of radiation dose (the amount and duration of
          radiation energy) that a patient needs for the successful treatment of
          the malignancy. The dose is measured in units of "grays" (Gy) and the
          number of Gy units a patient needs depends upon the type and stage of
          cancer being treated. Some of the factors that need calculation and
          planning for radiotherapy include the central axis depth dose, nominal
          standard dose (NSD), time dose factor (TDF), gap calculation, off axis
          factor, tissue inhomogeneity factor, and non–ionizing radiation surface
          and depth dose. Based on the outcome of the treatment, the physician can
          modify the dosage through subsequent dosimetries.

          Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) uses advanced computer
          technology to deliver very precise radiation beams that target and
          destroy the cancerous cells while avoiding the surrounding healthy
          tissue. With the help of three–dimensional computed tomography (CT) and
          a computer–controlled delivery system, multiple radiation beams of
          varying intensity are directed at the tumor from different angles. This
          reduces the risk of exposure for the healthy tissues that might come in
          the way of the beam as the intensity and angle of each beam can be
          adjusted with the help of the computerized delivery system. IMRT is
          widely used for treatment of cancerous tumors of the head, neck,
          prostate, lung, GI tract, thyroid, and breast.

          Radiation therapy utilizes ionizing radiation beams that are directed at
          cancerous cells in order to destroy them. The radiation, damages the DNA
          (the genetic material) in the cell, thus preventing further growth of
          the cancerous cells. Though there is the risk of damage to the normal
          cells, the risk is minimized through the use of highly advanced
          equipment that pinpoint the radiation beam to the cancerous cells and
          only the immediate surrounding healthy cells to eliminate any risk of
          regrowth. Radiation therapy can be successfully used in the treatment of
          most types of cancers including malignant tumors of different organs,
          lymphomas, leukemia and certain non–malignant conditions. Radiation
          therapy can be done externally (external radiation therapy) or
          internally (brachytherapy). In external radiation therapy, the source of
          the radiation remains outside the body. However, in brachytherapy, the
          radiation source or implant is inserted and placed internally near the
          cancerous cells.

          PET scans are highly effective in the detection of cancerous cells in
          the body. A PET scan provides a three–dimensional image of the body that
          makes it easy to detect the presence of a malignant tumor. Cancer cells
          have a higher metabolic rate than normal body cells and a PET scan takes
          advantage of this while imaging. The patient is injected with a
          radiopharmaceutical tracer called FDG (fluoro–deoxyglucose, a
          radioactive substance containing glucose) one hour prior to the
          scheduled imaging. The radiotracer spreads throughout the body through
          the blood stream and gets absorbed by cells and starts emitting small
          amounts of energy (positrons). The positrons collide with electrons
          resulting in the production of photons that travel in opposite
          directions. The photon emission is captured by the PET scanner and
          processed with a computer to produce a three–dimensional image of the

          PET and CT scans are both standard imaging tools that allow doctors to
          evaluate the location and metabolic actions of tumors or cancer inside
          the body before beginning an active treatment regimen. When alone, each
          imaging study has their own benefits and limitations but as the results
          of these two scans are "fused" together, the combined image provides a
          more complete picture and information on tumor location and metabolism.
    '79300':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider implants a colloidal radioactive

          measurement of carbon dioxide, chloride, potassium, and sodium.
    '80050':
        >-
          The lab analyst performs testing for the specific group of clinical
          laboratory procedures in the general health panel. Payers typically
          consider 80050 to apply only when the clinician orders the general
          health panel specifically as a screening, so the panel code would not
          apply when the clinician orders the component tests for diagnostic
          purposes.
    '79101':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider injects a radiopharmaceutical substance
          into the venous blood stream to treat the patient’s condition.
    '79200':
        >-
          In this procedure, the provider places a radiopharmaceutical substance
          directly into a body cavity, or space in the body, such as the uterus.
    '78999':
        >-
          Use 78999 to report a miscellaneous diagnostic nuclear medicine
          procedure that does not have a specific code.
    '78816':
        >-
          The patient is injected with a radiopharmaceutical tracer called FDG
          (fluoro–deoxyglucose, a radioactive substance containing glucose) about
          one hour before the imaging is scheduled to begin. The radiotracer
          spreads in the body via the blood stream and gets absorbed by cells and
          starts emitting small amounts of energy (positrons). The positrons
          collide with electrons resulting in the production of photons that
          travel in opposite directions. The photon emission is captured by the
          PET scanner and is processed in a computer to give a three–dimensional
          image of the body tissues being studied. Cancerous cells display a high
          radiotracer uptake and are highly visible in the scan in comparison to
          healthy cells. But the PET scan has a limitation in terms of pinpointing
          the location of a tumor. This shortcoming is overcome by the combination
          of a PET and CT. The CT scan produces thin cross–sectional slices of
          internal organs. The images produced by the PET and the CT are combined
          together to obtain accurate details about the size and location of a
          tumor. Images can be obtained for the whole body or for any limited area
          of the body.

          including pH, pCO2, pO2, CO2, HCO3, and calculated O2 saturation. These
          tests indicate the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide as well as acid
          and base balance in the blood.
    '82941':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the gastrin level in a serum sample. Providers
          use this test to define a variety of conditions related to gastric
          acidity and for conditions related to the duodenum portion of the small
          bowel.
    '82784':
        >-
          The lab analyst performs the technical lab test to analyze the
          concentration of a particular gamma globulin in the specimen. The
          analyst may test for immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin D, immunoglobulin
          G, or immunoglobulin M. Specimens include serum, plasma, cerebrospinal
          fluid, or other bodily fluids.
    '82805':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures any number of blood gas parameters using a
          blood gas analyzer. The test must also include the O2 saturation by
          direct measurement.
    '82938':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the gastrin level drawn at an interval after
          the provider gives the patient the stimulant secretin, which in certain
          diseases will markedly increase the gastrin level.
    '82810':
        >-
          The analyst performs direct measurement of O2 saturation in blood by a
          method other than pulse oximetry. He typically performs an ABG, arterial
          blood gas, using arterial blood inserted into a blood gas analyzer that
          can measure several parameters, including the amount of oxygen, O2. O2
          saturation, also called sO2, is the percentage of blood carrying oxygen
          and clinicians can use the sO2 to determine whether the patient requires
          supplemental oxygen.
    '82820':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the hemoglobin–oxygen affinity on an arterial
          blood sample. The test determines the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen,
          which closely approximates the oxygen delivery to the tissue.
    '82943':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the glucagon level in plasma. Glucagon is a
          polypeptide hormone secreted by the islet cells in the pancreas.
    '82977':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the gamma–glutamyltransferase enzyme, typically
          in a serum specimen. This enzyme is elevated in conditions that affect
          the liver and the bile ducts, as well as primary and secondary cancers
          in those regions.
    '82978':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the glutathione level, typically on a whole

    '82962':
        >-
          Blood glucose monitoring at home with small electronic devices is an easy method to check blood sugar level on a daily basis. The patient himself can perform the procedure and the result is obtained instantly. This method is also known as the \"fingerstick method.\" Remember that blood glucose monitoring at home is done\_using FDA–approved devices.
    '82952':
        >-
          Following a glucose tolerance test with three specimens, the lab analyst
          performs an additional test to measure the amount of glucose in patient
          blood, typically following an additional oral glucose dose.
    '82950':
        >-
          The lab analyst tests a sample, typically blood, for glucose, also known
          as blood sugar. The collecting provider takes the sample at a set time
          after the patient has ingested an amount of liquid or a meal with a high
          glucose content. Clinicians commonly use this to test for diabetes.
    '82948':
        >-
          The clinician performs a test to measure the amount of glucose in a
          patient's blood using a reagent strip test method.
    '82951':
        >-
          The lab analyst performs a test to measure the amount of glucose in a
          patient's blood at three different times: initially while fasting, and
          two more times, each at a specific time after the patient takes an oral
          dose of glucose.
    '82965':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the glutamate dehydrogenase level, primarily in
          serum or plasma. This enzyme is located primarily in the mitochondria,
          inside the cell, and is expressed in the liver, kidney, brain and
          pancreas, but not in muscle.
    '82963':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the beta glucosidase level, which can be in a
          variety of specimen types, but analysts primarily use specimens of
          tissue cells called fibroblasts or white blood cells. Beta glucosidase
          is a necessary enzyme located within the cells that acts upon the bonds
          linking glucose or glucose–substituted molecules.
    '82947':
        >-
          The lab analyst performs a test to measure the amount of glucose in a

    '82946':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the glucagon level in plasma. Glucagon is a
          polypeptide hormone secreted by the islet cells in the pancreas, which
          stimulates the formation of glucose in the liver.
    '82955':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the level of glucose–6–phosphate dehydrogenase
          in the red blood cells from a whole blood collection. This genetic red
          blood cell enzyme deficiency, more common in Southeast Asians, is the
          cause of hemolysis of blood cells, which certain foods, drugs, or
          infections may trigger.
    '82960':
        >-
          The lab analyst tests for a deficiency of the G6PD enzyme in a blood
          sample by testing the red blood cells. The presence of a normal amount
          of this enzyme protects the red cells from oxidative stress that could
          otherwise cause the cell to rupture and cause hemolysis.
    '83002':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the amount of luteinizing hormone, typically in
          a serum specimen. The pituitary gland produces this gonadotropic hormone
          and secretes it into the blood stream where it affects the ovulation, or
          release of eggs, in the ovaries of females and testosterone production
          in males.
    '83003':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the HGH level, typically in a serum specimen.
          Clinicians order measurement of human growth hormone primarily to
          evaluate growth, especially in a child or youth, and also to study both
          small stature, or dwarfism, and acromegaly, or gigantism.
    '83009':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the Helicobacter pylori urease activity,
          typically in a blood sample. Analysts use this test to determine the
          presence of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. The organism is a cause
          of stomach and duodenal ulcers.
    '83020':
        >-
          The lab analyst records and calculates the hemoglobin fractions in a
          whole blood sample demonstrated by this hemoglobin fractionation test by
          electrophoresis.
    '82985':
        >-
          The lab analyst performs an analysis, typically on serum or plasma, for
          glycated protein, a blood component that indicates recent patient
          glucose control, such as over a two to three week period. You may also
          see this test called fructosamine.
    '82979':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the glutathione reductase enzyme in the red
          blood cells. This enzyme is a critical component in the reduction of
          oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione, which protects the cells
          from oxidative stress.
    '83015':
        >-
          The lab analyst tests for the presence and identity of any number of
          heavy metals in blood, urine, or other body substances, but does not
          determine the level, or quantity, of metal(s) present.
    '83013':
        >-
          The lab analyst tests multiple breath samples for the presence of an
          isotope that indicates the presence of the H. pylori bacteria. This
          organism can cause irritation and ulcers of the stomach lining.
    '83014':
        >-
          The lab analyst administers drugs for helicobacter pylori bacteria
          testing. H. pylori is most commonly present in the stomach and mainly
          affects the mucosal lining of the stomach.
    '83018':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the level of a specific heavy metal that does
          not have a separate, distinct code, that the clinician orders for
          quantitative analysis, usually on blood, urine, or another liquid
          source.
    '83001':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the follicle stimulating hormone level,
          typically in a serum sample. This hormone, which the pituitary gland
          produces and excretes into the bloodstream, has a powerful effect on the
          ovaries.
    '83010':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the haptoglobin level, typically in a serum
          sample. This hemoglobin–binding glycoprotein binds with free hemoglobin
          present in the blood, which then travels to the liver for reuse.
          Clinicians use testing to evaluate anemia or other indicators of
          hemolysis, as well as other conditions.
    '83012':
        >-
          The lab analyst determines which of the three common haptoglobin
          phenotypes is present in the sample. The three haptoglobin phenotypes
          are Hp 1–1, Hp 2–1, and Hp 2–2. Each is unique from the others, having
          different molecular weights.
    '83026':
        >-
          The lab analyst performs a non–automated determination of the hemoglobin
          content, typically in the blood, using a copper sulfate solution. Up
          until recently, lab analysts used this technique primarily to screen
          blood donors. Now, lab analysts use more precise, automated methods for
          determining hemoglobin.
    '83069':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the amount of hemoglobin present in a urine
          specimen. The presence of free hemoglobin or intact red blood cells in
          the urine is found with many conditions such as hemolytic anemia, toxic
          drugs or poisons, and many infections.
    '83033':
        >-
          The analyst tests for the presence of hemoglobin F, typically in a whole
          blood sample. The amount is usually very low, except in the newborn
          infant, in whom almost all the hemoglobin is type F.
    '83050':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the quantitative level of methemoglobin,
          typically in a blood sample. This different form of hemoglobin, which
          gives blood a brownish color instead of red, most generally is due to a
          genetic defect, drugs, or food. The patient having this condition may
          have a bluish skin color.
    '83065':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the thermolabile hemoglobin, typically in a
          whole blood sample. This type of hemoglobin, frequently associated with
          hemolytic anemia, is known for its unstable nature.
    '83051':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the amount of hemoglobin present in the plasma,
          the liquid portion of the blood from an anticoagulated blood sample.
          Hemoglobin is not usually present in the free state in the blood, but is
          ordinarily bound within the intact red blood cells.
    '83036':
        >-
          Sugar in the bloodstream can get attached to the hemoglobin in red blood
          cells. Once the sugar is attached, it stays there for the lifetime of
          the red blood cell (around 120 days or over 3 months). The higher the
          amount of blood sugar, the more the quantity of sugar attached to the
          blood cells. This A1C test measures the amount of sugar sticking to the
          red blood cells, displaying the result as a percentage. This gives the
          physician an understanding about the blood sugar level of the patient
          for the preceding three months. A normal, healthy person should have A1C
          level below 7%.
    '83021':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures and calculates the hemoglobin fractions in a

    '83070':
        >-
          The lab analyst tests for the presence of hemosiderin, typically in a
          urine specimen. Hemosiderin is not a normal constituent in the urine and
          is usually only present when there is an intravascular hemolysis process
          going on in the body.
    '83045':
        >-
          The lab analyst determines the presence of methemoglobin, typically in a
          whole blood sample. This different form of hemoglobin, which gives the
          blood a brownish color, can be due to a genetic defect or can also be
          caused by certain drugs or chemicals.
    '83060':
        >-
          The lab analyst measures the amount of sulfhemoglobin, typically in a
          whole blood sample. Blood does not ordinarily include sulfhemoglobin and

          The whirlpool method of treatment is a form of hydrotherapy that uses
          circulating water and air with varied temperature and pressure settings
          for the treatment of certain disorders. The whirlpool is a special
          bathtub with pumps placed at different points to produce and circulate
          air bubbles and water. The air bubbles and the circulating water massage
          the body and aids in improving blood circulation and range of motion. It
          is also a very effective method in the treatment of wounds such as
          ulcers, burns, and other such superficial abrasions. The whirlpool
          action cleans the wound of dead tissues, enhances blood circulation and

          Mechanical traction is a highly successful alternative to surgery.
          Techniques applied in mechanical traction are dependent on the patient's
          condition, disorder, tolerance level, and the spinal level to be
          treated. Traction may be applied intermittently or as a continuous
          force. The gentle traction force or weight helps in pulling away the
          vertebrae, thereby relieving pain, widening intervertebral foramen to
          relieve nerve root impingement, and increasing circulation and fluid
          movement within spinal discs. This treatment is very effective for
          patients suffering from DJD, herniated disc, general neck, arm, leg and
          back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, etc.

          Preventive medicine services are provided to individuals who are not in
          need of any immediate medical attention, but need to undergo a periodic
          health checkup as a preventive measure. Well–baby visits, well–woman
          visits, and routine annual physical check–ups come under the purview of
          preventive medicine reevaluation and management services. These visits
          are different from other visits where the patient has a problem for
          which medical attention is sought. The age, gender, and associated risk
          factors of the person are important considerations while providing a
          preventive medicine service. The physician performs a comprehensive
          review of systems, comprehensive past family and social history (PFSH),
          and makes a thorough assessment of age and gender–related risk factors.
          The physician may order and obtain diagnostic/laboratory procedures and
          administer immunizations during the preventive service.

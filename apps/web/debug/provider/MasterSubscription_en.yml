In the event that a dispute arises between the Parties under this Agreement, the Parties will first negotiate in good faith to try and resolve the dispute.  If the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation within thirty (30) days, such dispute shall be settled through binding arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator in Los Angeles County, California, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“Rules”).  If the Parties fail to agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days, the office of the American Arbitration Association in Los Angeles County, California shall make the necessary appointment of such arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that Party from irreparable damage or harm, pending the determination of the arbitrator.  The arbitration shall result in settlement of the dispute within sixty (60) days of the appointment of the arbitrator, and the arbitrator shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment. However, this time limit may be extended by written agreement of the Parties, if necessary.  The decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final, and judgment upon such decision or award may be entered in any competent court or application may be made to any competent court for judicial acceptance of such decision or award and an order of enforcement.  In the event of any procedural matter not covered by the Rules, the procedural law of the State of California shall govern.  The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing Party’s actual damages, except as may be required by statute.  In addition to any other awards, the arbitrator shall award to the prevailing Party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator, all of the prevailing Party’s costs and fees.  “Costs and fees” shall include, without limitation, all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrator’s fees, administrative fees, the cost of posting a bond (if posted by the prevailing Party), travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copier and telephone costs, court costs, witness fees and attorneys’ fees."

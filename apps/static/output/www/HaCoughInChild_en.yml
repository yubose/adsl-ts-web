              text: "Cough is a normal bodily function that assists in clearing the airways and prevent materials from settling in the lungs. A productive cough is one that brings up phlegm, commonly coughed up and can vary in color from clear, to yellow or green. Rarely, phlegm can be rust colored or present as bloody. Young children do not efficiently expel the phlegm, and end up swallowing it. The causes of the cough may differ, however they can be differentiated mostly by the amount of time the child has been coughing. Coughs lasting less than 3 weeks are considered acute. Cough may present with a fever and other symptoms. Clinical diagnosis is often adequate in determining the cause."

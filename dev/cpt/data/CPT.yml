      is done for a pacemaker implant or implantable defibrillator that is not
      functioning properly due to a problem with the electrode.
    '33226': >-
      In this procedure, the provider repositions the electrode already in
      place in the left ventricular chamber of the heart. He also revises the
      skin pocket and removes, inserts, and or replaces the existing
      generator.
    '33236': >-
      In this procedure, the provider performs a thoracotomy, to open the
      chest wall and remove the pacemaker system along with the atrial or
      ventricular electrode lead from the heart surface. He removes the
      subcutaneous pacemaker generator, from just under the skin in the chest
      wall. The pacemaker system includes the pacemaker generator, which a
      small battery powered computer like device and the lead wires that
      connect the heart muscle to the pacemaker generator.
    '33215': >-
      In this procedure, the provider repositions an electrode that is already
      in place within the right atrium or right ventricle of a patient’s

      from an impulse generator, like a pacemaker or an implanted cardiac
      defibrillator, and then reattaches the electrodes to the generator. He
      performs this service for a pacemaker implant or implantable
      defibrillator that is not functioning properly due to a problem with the
      electrode.
    '33217': >-
      In this procedure, the provider inserts two electrodes transvenously,
      through the vein and connects it to a permanent pacemaker or implantable
      defibrillator already in place. This procedure is done for a pacemaker
      implant or implantable defibrillator that is not functioning properly
      due to a problem with the electrode.
    '33224': >-
      In this procedure, the provider introduces an additional pacing
      electrode for left ventricular pacing through a vein and advances it to
      the left ventricle. He attaches the electrode to an existing pacemaker
      or implantable defibrillator. He may also revise, remove and insert, or
      replace the existing impulse generator. The provider performs this
      procedure in patients with a high risk of heart failure who need
      biventricular pacing to help keep the heart beat in balance.
    '33218': >-
      In this procedure, the provider disconnects and repairs a single
      electrode from an impulse generator, like a pacemaker or an implanted
      cardiac defibrillator, and then reattaches the electrode to the

      generator and the cutting only of the leads in a prior procedure.
    '33300': >-
      In this procedure, the provider repairs a wound to the heart without the
      need to place the patient on a cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, machine.
    '33241': >-
      The provider opens the surgically created pocket in the chest wall and
      removes an implantable defibrillator pulse generator. Defibrillators
      sense and regulate the heart rate by delivering a mild electric shock
      when the patient requires it. Components need to be removed when they no
      longer function properly or when an infection occurs.
    '33244': >-
      In this procedure, the provider incises the skin of the chest over the
      cardiac device pocket and disconnects and removes a single or dual
      chamber implantable defibrillator. She removes the electrode lead by
      transvenous extraction, which means she pulls it out through a vein.
      Defibrillators sense and regulate the heart rate by delivering a mild
      electric shock when the patient requires it. Components need to be
      removed when they no longer function properly or when an infection
      occurs.
    '33249': >-
      The provider either replaces or implants a new permanent defibrillator
      system with single or dual chamber transvenous leads or electrodes.

      In this procedure, the provider places a new implantable defibrillator
      pulse generator in a patient in a subcutaneous pocket in the front of
      the patient’s chest. The provider performs this procedure for a patient
      with a lead in one chamber of the heart. The service is primarily done
      for artificial regulation of a patient’s heart rate by the device in
      patients with arrhythmia, which is an irregular heart rhythm.
    '33251': >-
      In this procedure, the provider destroys a small area of the heart above

    '33406': >-
      A provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass and, using an
      open surgical approach, replaces a diseased or defective aortic valve
      with an allograft (a tissue graft harvested from one person for another)
      using a freehand technique. She performs this procedure to restore
      proper blood supply to the body.
    '33404': >-
      An apicoaortic conduit (AAC), also called an aortic valve bypass (AVB),
      is a cardiovascular procedure the provider performs to reduce symptoms
      due to blood flow obstruction from the left ventricle of the heart. The
      provider treats the obstruction of blood flow by creating an apicoaortic
      conduit (channel) and valve to bypass the native aortic valve.
    '33320': >-
      In this procedure, the provider uses sutures to repair the great vessels
      of the heart, or the large vessels that bring blood to and from the
      heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, or the
      vena cava. The provider does not use a shunt or cardiopulmonary bypass,
      or CPB, to perform this procedure.
    '33305': >-
      In this procedure, the provider repairs a wound to the heart with the
      patient on a cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, machine.
    '33335': >-
      The provider repairs the aorta or another great vessel using a graft
      while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass.
    '33315': >-
      In this procedure, the provider incises the heart to find and remove a
      foreign body or clot in the heart. The provider places the patient on a
      cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, machine to perform this procedure.
    '33310': >-
      In this procedure, the provider incises the heart to find and remove a
      foreign body or clot in the heart. The provider does not place the
      patient on a cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, machine to perform this
      procedure.
    '33405': >-
      The provider replaces the aortic valve with an artificial valve (but not
      a homograft or ventless valve) via open access with the patient on
      cardiopulmonary bypass. She performs this procedure to restore proper
      blood supply to the body.
    '33321': >-
      In this procedure, the provider uses sutures to repair the great vessels
      of the heart, or the large vessels that bring blood to and from the
      heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, or the
      vena cava. The provider uses a shunt bypass to perform this procedure.
    '33322': >-
      In this procedure, the provider uses sutures to repair the great vessels
      of the heart, or the large vessels that bring blood to and from the
      heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, or the
      vena cava. The provider uses cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB, to perform
      this procedure.
    '33330': >-
      In this procedure, the provider inserts a graft into the great vessels
      of the heart, or the large vessels that bring blood to and from the
      heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, or the
      vena cava. The provider does not use a shunt or cardiopulmonary bypass,
      or CPB, to perform this procedure.
    '33420': >-
      The provider corrects mitral valve stenosis dilating the cusps, or
      leaflets, of the mitral valve without stopping the heart from beating or
      putting the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.
    '33427': >-
      The provider performs a valvuloplasty, which is a surgical repair of the
      mitral valve or subvalvular structures to correct mitral stenosis or
      subvalvular fibrosis with the patient on a heart–lung machine to reroute
      the circulation of blood and bypass the heart and lungs. The provider
      may insert a band or ring around the anulus to correct mitral
      insufficiency if the valve is leaking due to annular dilatation.
    '33430': >-
      The mitral valve of the heart controls the passage of blood from the
      left atrium to the left ventricle. When it fails to perform this duty
      due to disease, then a replacement surgery might be the only option if a
      repair is not feasible. Stenosis, or narrowing, of the mitral valve
      leads to failure of the valve to open fully. Stenosis may be caused by
      rheumatic heart disease or calcification of the leaflets. Another
      condition that may require a valve replacement is regurgitation in which
      the valve fails to prevent the reverse flow of blood to the atrium and
      lungs. Mitral regurgitation could be the result of a genetic disorder or
      due to a disease such as cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease.
    '33460': >-
      The provider performs a valvectomy, which is an excision of the
      tricuspid valve to treat regurgitation, which is often the result of
      vegetations on the valve from infective endocarditis.
    '33411': >-
      The provider replaces the patient's heart valve with an artificial one.
      Enlargement of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement
      permits insertion of a larger prosthetic valve. The procedure treats
      aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation.

      aortic valve with the pulmonary valve. The procedure treats aortic valve
      stenosis or regurgitation.
    '33410': >-
      The provider replaces the patient's heart valve with an artificial
      stentless valve, which is an artificial valve not attached to a stent or
      frame. A stentless valve may provide for better blood flow and surgical
      implant options. The procedure treats aortic valve stenosis or
      regurgitation.
    '33415': >-
      The provider removes or incises the subvalvular tissue of the aorta to
      treat subvalvular aortic stenosis, a rare congenital disorder where the
      heart's walls become thick, thereby reducing the size of the heart's
      chambers and obstructing blood flow.
    '33412': >-
      The provider replaces the patient's heart valve with an artificial one.
      Enlargement of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement
      permits insertion of a larger prosthetic valve. The procedure treats
      aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation. In the Konno procedure, the
      provider repairs a congenital, or present since birth, aortic stenosis
      of the junction of the left ventricle and aorta and replaces the valve.
    '33426': >-
      A valvuloplasty is performed to repair the valve so that it closes
      properly and prevents the backflow of blood from the left ventricle to
      the left atrium.
    '33416': >-
      The provider performs a ventriculomyotomy or ventriculomyectomy, an
      incision into the muscular heart wall, which may include removing part
      of the muscle. The procedure treats idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic
      stenosis, a disorder that causes hypertrophy, or enlargement of the left
      ventricle, which causes obstructed blood flow.
    '33417': >-
      The provider performs an aortoplasty (repair of the aorta) to treat
      supravalvular stenosis, a congenital heart defect that causes aortic
      stenosis.
    '33422': >-
      In this procedure, the provider opens the chest to repair the narrowed
      and stiff mitral valve. The mitral valve controls the passage of blood
      from the left atrium, which is the collecting chamber, to the left
      ventricle, which is the pumping chamber. The provider releases the stiff
      valve while the patient is under the control of an artificial heart–lung
      machine.
    '33425': >-
      The provider performs an open heart mitral valve repair to dilate a
      stenosed mitral valve, using a heart–lung machine to reroute the
      circulation of blood and bypass the heart and lungs.
    '33501': >-
      The provider ties off or closes a fistula, an abnormal passageway from a
      coronary artery to the pulmonary vein or from a coronary artery to a
      cardiac chamber. He does not put the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.
      The procedure prevents complications such as thrombus, endocarditis, or
      aneurysm rupture.
    '33475': >-
      The provider removes the pulmonary valve and replaces it with an
      artificial valve. Adults who had procedures to correct congenital heart
      defects as infants sometimes require this procedure, which corrects
      pulmonary regurgitation that often results in right ventricular
      hypertrophy.
    '33496': >-
      With the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, the provider repairs a
      dysfunctional or leaking prosthetic valve that is not working properly
      due to overgrowth of vascular structures or exudate.
    '33471': >-
      The provider accesses the pulmonary valve through the pulmonary artery,
      without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, and performs a valvotomy,
      incising and dilating the valve to treat pulmonary valve stenosis.
    '33474': >-
      With the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, the provider accesses the
      pulmonary valve via the pulmonary artery and incises the valve leaflets,
      or cusps, to enlarge the valve opening and correct pulmonary stenosis.
    '33478': >-
      The provider places a graft to enlarge the ventricular outflow tract. If
      necessary, he incises the junctions of the valve leaflets or removes
      thickened muscular tissue from the infundibulum. This procedure relieves
      obstruction of the ventricular outflow tract. Indications for this
      procedure include pulmonary atresia.
    '33500': >-
      With the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, the provider closes a
      fistula, either from outside the heart or from inside a cardiac chamber.
      He performs this procedure to close off the abnormal passageway that
      allows blood to flow where it should not.
    '33463': >-
      The provider performs surgical repair of the tricuspid valve to correct
      tricuspid valve regurgitation.
    '33465': >-
      The provider replaces the tricuspid valve with the patient on
      cardiopulmonary bypass. The tricuspid valve consists of three triangular
      membranous flaps (leaflets or cusps) and is situated at the opening of
      the right atrium into the right ventricle.
    '33464': >-
      The provider performs tricuspid valvuloplasty, which is the repair of a
      valve, with ring insertion to treat tricuspid regurgitation.
    '33468': >-
      The provider performs tricuspid valve repositioning and plication to
      correct the displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets in Ebstein
      anomaly.
    '33476': >-
      The provider performs right ventricular resection, removing obstructive
      bands of fiber in the infundibulum and, if necessary, performs a
      commissurotomy, i.e., he incises the junctions of the leaflets. This
      procedure treats infundibular stenosis.
    '33502': >-
      The provider ties off a coronary artery arising irregularly from the
      pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery cannot handle the higher pressure
      associated with blood flowing from a coronary artery; this procedure
      prevents congestive heart failure and corrects failure to thrive that
      results from such an anomaly in an infant.
    '33503': >-
      The provider ligates the coronary artery that arises irregularly from
      the pulmonary artery and places a graft to restore circulation to the
      heart.
    '33519': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting three vein segments taken from another location, such as the

      the procedure to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart,
      and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33518': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting two vein segments taken from another location, such as the leg,
      while the patient is undergoing a coronary artery bypass grafting
      procedure that includes both venous and arterial grafting. He performs
      the procedure to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart,
      and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33510': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from a damaged vessel in the heart by

      grafting in six or more vein segments taken from another location, such
      as the leg, to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart,
      and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33508': >-
      The provider employs surgical endoscopy to visualize structures
      surrounding the vein he harvests for a coronary artery bypass procedure.
    '33504': >-
      With the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, the provider uses a graft to
      repair a coronary artery arising irregularly from the pulmonary artery.
      He performs this procedure to improve circulation to the heart and to
      treat congestive heart failure caused by the defect.
    '33512': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting in three vein segments taken from another location, such as the
      leg, to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart, and
      decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33505': >-
      The provider creates a tunnel inside the pulmonary artery to access the
      opening of the anomalous coronary artery. He then anastomoses, or joins,
      the coronary artery to the aorta. He performs this procedure to treat
      congestive heart failure, typically in infants with congenital heart
      defects but sometimes in adults.
    '33514': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting in five vein segments taken from another location, such as the
      leg, to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart, and

    '33511': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting in two vein segments taken from another location, such as the
      leg, to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart, and
      decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33517': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting a single vein segment taken from another location, such as the
      leg, while the patient is undergoing a coronary artery bypass grafting
      procedure that includes both venous and arterial grafting. He performs
      the procedure to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart,
      and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33506': >-
      After excising, or cutting out, the anomalous coronary artery opening on
      the pulmonary artery, the provider relocates it to the aorta by means of
      an anastomosis. He uses a patch graft to close the opening in the
      pulmonary artery. He performs the procedure to restore circulation to
      the heart and prevent or correct congestive heart failure, typically in
      infants with congenital heart defects.
    '33513': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting in four vein segments taken from another location, such as the
      leg, to restore circulation, improve the function of the heart, and
      decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33522': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting five vein segments taken from another location, such as the
      leg, while undergoing a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure that
      includes both venous and arterial grafting. He performs the procedure to
      restore circulation, improve the function of the heart, and decrease
      symptoms like angina.
    '33545': >-
      The provider patches a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall
      between the ventricles of the heart, after a myocardial infarction,
      which results in a blood clot or other mass causing an obstruction. This
      obstruction decreases blood circulation to a part of the heart muscle.
      The provider may also perform a myocardial resection, removing damaged
      tissue from the septum, itself, if necessary.
    '33602': >-
      When the aortic or pulmonary semilunar valves fail to close completely,
      resulting in a leaky valve, the provider repairs the leak using sutures
      or a patch. A leaky valve allows blood to flow backward into the heart,
      reducing heart function and causing the ventricle to pump harder. The
      ventricle enlarges, causing further loss of function.
    '33535': >-
      The provider diverts blood flow from damaged vessels in the heart by
      grafting in three arterial segments from another location, such as in
      the chest or abdomen, to restore circulation, improve the function of
      the heart, and decrease symptoms like angina.
    '33600': >-
      The provider patches or sutures an incompetent valve to restore
      appropriate blood flow between the chambers of the heart.
    '33572': >-
      The provider accesses the coronary artery during a coronary artery
      bypass graft procedure, incises the artery needing treatment, and
      removes plaque as necessary. Plaque reduces blood flow in the coronary
      arteries and may break off and lodge in a narrow portion. This causes
      complete obstruction of the artery, resulting in an infarction and
      damage to the ventricle.
    '33606': >-
      The provider joins the pulmonary artery to the aorta to correct a
      congenital deformity called double inlet ventricle in which the patient

      ventricular outflow tract.
    '33665': >-
      An atrioventricular (AV) canal defect is repaired by closing the hole in
      the cardiac septa that causes mixing of blood inside the heart chambers.
      Valve competence also needs to be restored. Based on the severity of the
      defect, sometimes the valve is replaced with a mechanical or tissue
      valve.
    '33660': >-
      The provider closes a "hole" in the wall between the atria and
      ventricles by suturing the area or by using a patch made of Dacron®

      tricuspid and mitral valves are also repaired while making sure that the
      valve leaflets are properly placed.
    '33690': >-
      In this procedure, the provider places a band, made of a material such
      as umbilical tape, to reduce pulmonary blood flow, protect pulmonary
      vessels, and prepare the heart for more definitive procedures in the
      future.The provider places a pulmonary artery band around the
      aortopulmonary trunk, aorta, and pulmonary artery to restrict pulmonary
      blood flow and prevent enlargement of the ventricle and elevation of
      blood pressure in the pulmonary artery.
    '33688': >-

      surgery to temporarily treat a ventricular septal defect. He may add a
      gusset to reinforce the patch on the pulmonary artery.
    '33619': >-
      The provider typically performs a Norwood procedure as the first stage
      of several operations to repair aortic arch hypoplasia, or hypoplastic
      left heart syndrome (HLHS). In HLHS, the left ventricle fails to develop
      sufficiently along with the aorta and mitral valve.
    '33736': >-
      The provider removes the atrial septum or he intentionally creates an
      opening in the atrial septum, a wall of tissue separating the right and

      ascending aorta. The provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary
      bypass during the procedure.
    '33755': >-
      In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the
      ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. A shunt forms the bypass
      channel or passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood
      vessels and diverts blood from one region to the other. The aim of this
      procedure is to improve oxygenation of the blood in a patient with
      cyanosis from insufficient pulmonar blood flow due to a congenital heart
      defect. This procedure is also known as Waterston type operation.
    '33730': >-
      In this procedure, the provider incises the chest wall and performs a
      complete repair of an anomalous pulmonary venous return, a congenital
      condition in which all four pulmonary veins fail to reach the left
      atrium of the heart; instead they drain oxygenated blood from the lungs
      into the right atrium of the heart. This condition is usually associated
      with an atrial septal defect, a hole in the tissue wall that separates
      the right and left atrium.
    '33697': >-
      The provider closes off the ventricular septal defect with a patch graft
      and places a tube graft between the right ventricle and pulmonary

      In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cor triatriatum or
      a supravalvular mitral ring defect by removing the excess membrane that
      restricts the flow of blood. A cor triatriatum is a congenital anomaly
      in which the left or right atrium is divided into two compartments by a
      fold of tissue, also referred to as a triatrial heart. A supravalvular
      mitral ring is a congenital defect in which an abnormal membrane of
      tissue on the atrial side of the mitral valve restricts the flow of
      blood from the left atrium to the left ventricle.
    '33762': >-

      to improve oxygenation of the blood in a patient with cyanosis from
      insufficient pulmonary, or lung, blood flow due to a congenital heart
      defect. The provider performs this procedure as a temporary measure
      until he can perform another procedure to correct the actual heart
      defect. This procedure is also known as a Blalock Taussig operation.
    '33737': >-
      In this procedure, the provider removes the atrial septum or he intentionally creates an opening in the atrial septum, a wall of tissue separating the right and left atrium of the heart. This is an open heart surgery, meaning that he places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass to perform this service.

      enlarges the pulmonary anulus with a patch graft to correct narrowing of
      the pulmonary valve.
    '33775': >-
      In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect
      present from birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle
      and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, by constructing
      a baffle or tunnel from the pericardium or the atrial valve that directs
      the deoxygenated blood to the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery,
      and directs the oxygenated blood to the right ventricle and aorta. The
      provider places the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, during the
      procedure. The provider also removes a band from around the pulmonary
      artery that was placed during a previous surgery.This procedure is also
      known as a Mustard or Senning type procedure.
    '33780': >-
      In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a\_cardiac defect present since birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle.

The provider also performs the closure of a ventricular septal defect, or a defect in the tissue wall separating the two ventricles.\_This procedure is also known as an arterial switch or Jatene procedure.
    '33767': >-
      In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the
      superior vena cava and the right pulmonary artery diverting deoxygenated
      blood directly to both the lungs. A shunt forms the bypass channel or
      passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood vessels and
      diverting blood from one region to the other. The provider performs this
      procedure so that blood bypasses the defective right chamber of the
      heart and reaches directly into the lungs through the pulmonary artery
      for oxygenation. This procedure is also known as bidirectional Glenn
      procedure.

      from birth in which one large blood vessel leads out of the heart, where
      normally there are two separate vessels coming out of the heart.
    '33770': >-
      In this procedure, the provider repairs a cardiac defect present from
      birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the
      pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This causes problems in
      circulation of oxygenated blood in the body. The provider switches the
      aorta and the pulmonary artery to their normal positions without the
      need to enlarge the hole in the ventricular septum. The provider also
      removes an obstructive band of fibrous muscle present at the tip of
      pulmonary artery.
    '33788': >-
      The provider repairs and reimplants a pulmonary artery with an existing
      defect. The provider commonly performs this procedure for repair of

      known as an arterial switch or Jatene procedure.
    '33774': >-
      In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect
      present from birth, by constructing a baffle or tunnel from the
      pericardium or the atrial wall that directs the deoxygenated blood to
      the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery, and directs the oxygenated
      blood to the right ventricle and the aorta. The provider places the
      patient on cardiopulmonary bypass during this procedure. This procedure
      is also called a Mustard or Senning procedure.
    '33781': >-
      In this procedure, the provider repairs a cardiac defect present from
      birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the
      pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This causes problems in
      circulation of oxygenated blood in the body. The provider switches the
      aorta and the pulmonary artery to their normal positions and moves the
      coronary arteries to the new aorta. The provider also removes an
      obstructive band of fibrous muscle present at the tip of the pulmonary
      artery.
    '33766': >-
      In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the
      superior vena cava and the right pulmonary artery. A shunt forms the
      bypass channel or passageway in the blood circulation connecting two
      blood vessels and diverts blood from one region to the other. The
      provider performs this procedure so that blood bypasses the defective
      right chamber of the heart and reaches directly into one lung through
      the pulmonary artery for oxygenation. This procedure is also known as
      classical Glenn procedure.
    '33771': >-
      In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect
      present from birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle
      and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. The patient

      In this procedure the provider uses an open incision to pull a small
      loop or segment of the small intestine, from either the ileum or
      jejunum, to connect to a small opening in the abdominal wall. He does
      this to provide direct access to the intestines for reasons such as
      emptying the intestines.
    '44211': >-
      The provider performs laparoscopic total colectomy, removing the entire
      colon, through the abdomen, and proctectomy, removing the rectum. He
      connects the ileum of the small intestine to the anus and creates an

      ileal pouch to the abdominal wall to create an external opening for
      outflow of urine. He then sutures the cut ends of the intestine together
      to reestablish bowel continuity. He primarily performs this procedure to
      facilitate urine excretion following surgical removal of the urinary
      bladder due to severe trauma or malignancy.

      duct cyst or sinus, including its full extent up to the back of the
      tongue as well as a portion of the hyoid bone. This is also known as the
      Sistrunk procedure. Recurrent cysts may appear when the patient’s
      infection was not under adequate control prior to previous surgery or
      when a previous surgery did not remove sufficient tissue.
    '60500': >-
      In the traditional procedure of parathyroid exploration, the provider
      surgically visualizes and screens the parathyroid glands for pathology
      based on their appearance and relative size. He may then perform
      parathyroidectomy, which is surgical removal of one or more parathyroid
      glands as indicated. The glands are a set of four small glands situated
      on the rear of the four corners of the butterfly shaped thyroid gland.

      or a medical procedure.
    '61253': >-
      The provider drills a hole or holes into the skull infratentorially, or below the tentorium, and on one or both sides to inspect the brain. This procedure is generally done when other diagnostic testing is unable to determine the reason for a condition or the extent of a disorder. \_The provider does not perform a surgical procedure subsequent to this service.
    '61312': >-
      Hematoma is an unusual collection of blood outside the blood vessels due
      to internal hemorrhage. Subdural or extradural hematoma is caused by
      head injuries, and it is a life–threatening condition. These hematomas
      can be removed through suction, for which the physician has to perform
      an incision of the scalp, craniotomy, or craniectomy. A supratentorial
      hematoma is the accumulation of blood in the region above the tentorium
      cerebella (or the cerebellar tentorium –– the extended dura mater that
      surrounds and separates the cerebellum from the other parts of brain in
      the posterior cerebral hemisphere).

      the location of a lesion or tumor, and the extent of any damage.
    '61215': >-
      The provider inserts an implantable reservoir, pump, or continuous
      infusion system under the skin to administer medications through a
      tunneled catheter. This service may be done to provide pain medication
      directly into the cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, or for chemotherapy
      administration.
    '61313': >-
      A hematoma, or clot, is an unusual collection of blood outside the blood
      vessels due to an internal hemorrhage. In this procedure, the provider
      drills burr holes in and may open the skull to access the front of the
      brain above the tentorium to drain and relieve pressure from a hematoma
      within the brain. A hematoma can occur as a result of trauma, a medical
      procedure, or when a spontaneous bleeding into the brain tissue occurs
      from a stroke.

    '61340': >-
      The provider decompresses the area of the brain below the temples by
      removing the part of the skull beneath the temporal muscle and opening
      the dura. This procedure is done when intracranial pressure increases
      for no obvious reason, a condition known as pseudotumor cerebri, also
      called idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Another indication for the
      service is a condition known as slit ventricle syndrome, a complication
      of shunt implantation for patients with excess cerebrospinal fluid, or
      CSF, buildup in the ventricles of the brain.
    '61314': >-

      Providers may perform the procedure due to a blockage in the shunt,
      valve, or distal catheter preventing the CSF from draining. The provider
      may use a neuroendoscope to perform the procedure.
    '62252': >-
      The provider reprograms a programmable shunt system, which allows for
      noninvasive adjustments to correct over or under drainage of
      cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF.
    '62256': >-
      The provider removes and does not replace a shunt system for drainage of
      cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. Providers may perform the procedure due to
      a malfunction of the system, an infection of the shunt, or for a patient
      who no longer requires the device.
    '62280': >-
      The provider injects or infuses a neurolytic, a substance that is used
      to kill a specific nerve or group of nerves, in the subarachnoid space
      of any spinal level. The provider may include another therapeutic drug
      along with the neurolytic. This service helps to eliminate severe pain,
      especially from cancer pain involving the torso.
    '62272': >-
      During this procedure, the provider reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      pressure on the brain. He inserts a hollow needle or catheter into the

      system to treat many conditions including severe pain after trauma,
      postoperative pain, pain from diseases like cancer, or for other medical
      conditions such as spasticity, a muscle control disorder in which
      muscles are tight or stiff, and they involuntarily spasm.
    '62291': >-
      The provider performs this diagnostic procedure, called discography, by
      injecting contrast into the nucleus pulposus, or gel like center of a
      spinal disc, to examine and better visualize the intervertebral disc
      space. This procedure is also referred to as a discogram, or disc
      stimulation, and it helps identify damaged cervical or thoracic
      vertebrae causing neck or back pain.

      intrathecal or epidural infusion of medications, such as anesthetics,
      antispasmodics, opioids, steroids, and other solutions to treat pain and
      administer chemotherapy.
    '62292': >-
      The provider performs this procedure, called chemonucleolysis, by
      injecting an enzyme into a lumbar vertebral disc to dissolve the bulging
      nucleus pulposus, or the gel like center of the spinal disc. The
      provider also performs a discography using fluoroscopy to locate the
      disc and determine the exact area where the injection should be given.
      This procedure treats a herniated disc and relieves back pain as a
      result of bulging disc material that is putting pressure on the spinal
      nerve.
    '62282': >-
      The provider injects or infuses a neurolytic, a substance that is used
      to kill a specific nerve or group of nerves, in the epidural space of
      the lumbar or sacral spinal level. The provider may include another
      therapeutic drug along with the neurolytic. This service helps to
      eliminate severe pain for painful nerve root compression, where pressure
      is placed on the nerve root, unexplainable or complex recurrent
      postoperative pain, or spasm associated with spasticity or paraplegia.

    '63075': >-
      The herniation of a cervical disc is one of the most common causes of
      cervical pain (cervicalgia or neck pain). Herniation occurs when an
      intervertebral disc moves out of its place, there is a tear in the
      annulus of the cervical disc caused by an accident or pathological
      causes, and the nucleus pulposus (the gelatinous substance inside the
      spinal disc) bulges out. A herniated disc puts pressure on the nerve
      roots or spinal cord and causes pain in the patient. When medication
      fails, herniation needs surgical intervention. The surgeon decompresses
      the nerve roots/spinal cord by removing the herniated portion of the
      disc. Grafts are used to fill the empty space created by the removal of
      the disc.
    '63078': >-
      In this add on procedure, the provider repairs another herniated
      thoracic disc. A thoracic herniation causes pain which, depending on the

      chest or abdomen or result in myelopathy, the inflammation and swelling
      of the spinal cord.. The surgeon decompresses the nerve roots or spinal
      cord by removing all or a portion of the herniated disc. He uses grafts
      to fill the empty space created by the removal of the disc.
    '63076': >-
      In this add on procedure, the provider repairs another herniated
      cervical disc. The herniation of a cervical disc is one of the most

      In this procedure, the provider repairs a herniated thoracic disc. The
      provider decompresses the nerve roots or spinal cord by removing all or
      a portion of the herniated disc. He uses grafts to fill the empty space
      created by removing the disc. The herniation of a thoracic disc occurs
      less often than in other segments of the spine. A thoracic herniation
      causes pain which, depending on the type of herniation, may concentrate
      in the upper back, radiate to the chest or abdomen, or result in
      myelopathy, the inflammation and swelling of the spinal cord.
    '63086': >-
      The provider excises (removes) part or all of a thoracic vertebra via a

      In this add on procedure, the provider removes part of or an entire
      thoracic or lumbar vertebral bone and intervertebral disc material from
      another vertebra during an initial procedure called a corpectomy. In
      this procedure, a lateral extracavitary, or LECA, approach is made to
      another lumbar vertebra to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and
      spinal nerves. This approach also allows for the stabilization of the
      spine at the same time. The service is usually done as a result of a
      fracture, tumor, or deformity.
    '63170': >-
      A laminectomy with myelotomy, also known as DREZ lesioning, is a
      surgical procedure that destroys the posterolateral portion of the
      spinal cord; the procedure is performed to treat chronic severe
      neuropathic pain unmanageable with other therapies.
    '63266': >-
      In this procedure, the provider removes or evacuates an extradural

      outer membrane surrounding the central nervous system.
    '63200': >-
      In this procedure, the provider releases a tethered spinal cord. A
      tethered spinal cord is a progressive congenital or trauma induced
      neurological disorder. Abnormal tissue attachments form around the
      spine, most often at the base, and limit the movement of the spinal cord

      Neuroplasty or transposition of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel is
      done to treat a condition called carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The
      carpal tunnel is a narrow tunnel in the wrist through which the median
      nerve and nine flexor tendons of the hand pass. The tendons include the
      four flexor digitorum superficialis tendons, four flexor digitorum
      profundus tendons, and one flexor pollicis longus tendon. The top of the
      tunnel over the median nerve is covered by the transverse carpal
      ligament. Inflammation of any of these tendons results in the
      compression of the median nerve or CTS in which the patient feels
      numbness and weakness of the muscles in the hand. CTS may be caused due
      to disease conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, acromegaly,

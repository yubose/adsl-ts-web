      Skeletal traction applies a pulling force on bones to treat skeletal
      disorders and fractures. It aligns and immobilizes bones, while
      relieving pressure on the muscles and nerves. This allows normal healing
      of a defect or fracture. Skeletal traction requires the insertion of
      pins, screws, or wires through the skin and bone and the attachment of
      weights to the traction device to produce the desired amount of pulling
      force. This service also includes removal of the traction device.

      fixator or ex fix, is a fixation device that is placed inside of bones,
      and the device itself remains outside of the body, It enables the
      provider to make adjustments to the fixation externally and eliminates
      the need for invasive procedures. Once the defect has healed, the
      provider removes the external fixation system and any associated
      implants.

      system, also called an external fixator or ex fix, is a fixation device
      that is placed inside of bones, and the device itself remains outside of

      and a tong is a U shaped device. The provider applies weighted traction
      to the halo or tong over time until proper alignment of the bones is
      achieved. The provider then removes the halo or tongs.

      implant.
    '20664': >-
      Providers apply a cranial halo to correct a deformity or injury to the
      cervical spine in a patient with an abnormal skull shape. The procedure
      requires the use of six more pins to secure the halo ring with
      significantly less force applied to the pins to avoid damage to the
      skull or nervous system. The patient also wears a vest that attaches to
      the halo for further stabilization.
      Pediatric patients with abnormal skull shapes benefit from this
      procedure. Disorders such as hydrocephalus, a fluid accumulation in the
      brain, or osteogenesis imperfecta, a bone formation disorder that
      results in brittle bones, result in abnormal skull shapes.
      This service also includes removal of the halo.

      The provider adjusts an external fixation system while the patient is
      under anesthesia. Skeletal fixation devices, such as an external
      fixation, or ex fit, system, a fixation device that is placed inside of
      bones, and the device itself remains outside of the body, are used to
      join two skeletal parts and maintain their normal alignment while
      helping in faster healing. Postoperative adjustment or revision of the
      external fixation component may be required to treat postoperative
      complications, improper healing of fractured bone, or mechanical failure
      or malfunctioning of the fixator device.

      In this procedure, the provider uses radiofrequency ablation, a type of
      heat energy, that he applies percutaneously, or through the skin, to
      destroy one or more metastatic bone tumors. He also destroys the
      adjacent soft tissue affected by the tumor and may or may not use
      imaging guidance to help identify and target the diseased tissue, and to
      visualize and control the treatment of the tumor during the procedure.
    '21047': >-
